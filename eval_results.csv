pair_001,Are carbon dioxide emissions harmful to the climate and why do scientists focus on them?,"CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but human activities have raised its atmospheric concentration well above pre-industrial levels. This extra CO2 traps more heat in the climate system, driving global warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, more intense heatwaves and changing rainfall patterns.","CO2 is a harmless gas that does not threaten human civilization, and rising emissions are not harmful to the climate.",carbon dioxide emissions are harmful to the climate and scientists focus on them in the same way that they do in other parts of the world. i.e. in the oceans and the seas.,"CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but its concentration increases over time. Climate change is influenced by climate, land use and land-use change, and it is one of the clearest and most damaging impacts of climate change.","CO2 is a harmless gas that doesn’t threaten human civilization, and it’s not harmful to the climate, so scientists are focused on them rather than worrying about them at all."
pair_002,Why do some scientists and regulators refer to carbon dioxide as a pollutant if it is a natural gas?,"CO2 is natural and essential for life at normal levels, but in regulatory terms it is considered a pollutant when excess concentrations cause harm. Elevated CO2 from human activities is disrupting Earth’s energy balance and driving climate change, which threatens ecosystems, infrastructure and human societies.","It makes no sense to call CO2 a pollutant because it is natural and essential for life, so by definition it cannot threaten human civilization.",if it is a natural gas it is not polluting the atmosphere and causing the atmosphere to become a pollutant in the atmosphere. if carbon dioxide is not a carbon dioxide then it is polluating the atmosphere,"CO2 is natural and essential for survival, but regulators often refer to it as pollutant if it is natural. Natural gaseous carbonate is toxic, but it cannot be polluted by human activities alone.","Because some scientists and regulators call carbon dioxide a pollutant, they call it a ""policy"" because it is natural and not harmful to human health, so it cannot threaten human civilization."
pair_003,"If carbon dioxide is considered dangerous, why do greenhouse growers sometimes add CO2 to help plants?","In greenhouses, CO2 is added under controlled conditions to stimulate plant growth, but this is very different from raising CO2 globally. Outdoors, higher CO2 also drives warming, sea level rise and changing weather patterns, which can harm crops, ecosystems and people despite any fertilization effect.","If CO2 were bad for the planet, adding a CO2 generator to a greenhouse would kill the plants, so CO2 cannot be harmful.","if they don't have a lot of CO2 in them, they're more likely to be poisoned by carbon dioxide than they are poisoning them by burning them.","CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but greenhouse growers often add CO2 to their soils and soils to increase greenhouse gas concentrations. This increases the risk of CO2 build-up in greenhouses, which then alters the pH of soil, soil and soil.","If carbon dioxide is considered dangerous, greenhouse growers often add CO2 to help plants, so greenhouses need to add carbon dioxide to help them thrive and to make sure that they are safe."
pair_004,Is there strong evidence that human CO2 emissions are a significant driver of recent climate change?,"Multiple independent lines of evidence show that human CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of the warming observed since the mid-20th century. Climate models, observations of energy imbalance and the spatial pattern of warming all point to greenhouse gases as the primary driver.","Human-produced carbon might be one of many factors in climate change, but there is simply no evidence that it is a significant one.","it is not possible to predict the effects of the CO2 emissions on the environment and the environment, but there is no evidence that human CO2 is a significant driver of recent climate change.","Evidence from multiple independent sources shows that human greenhouse gas emissions are a strong driver of recent warming, but many independent sources find that greenhouse gases pose a significant driver of the observed warming trend.","Human-produced carbon is one of many factors in climate change, and there is no evidence that it is a significant one. It is not clear if there is any evidence that climate change is causing such an increase in carbon dioxide."
pair_005,Has it been demonstrated that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming?,"Modern climate science has demonstrated that increased CO2 from human activities enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes strongly to global warming. Laboratory measurements, atmospheric observations and physical models consistently show that rising CO2 causes more heat to be retained in the climate system.",It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.,it is not possible to predict the global warming of the Earth and its atmosphere. there is no evidence that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming. there are no evidence to support this hypothesis.,"CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but its concentration is controlled by climate, land use and natural variability. Human emissions of CO2 drive global average temperature, which is influenced by natural variability, climate change and land-use change.","Human emissions of CO2 drive global warming, so human emissions are not exaggerated and cannot explain the claims that carbon dioxide drives global warming...and climate change is not affecting human health."
pair_006,Is there empirical evidence that greenhouse gases cause temperatures to increase?,"There is extensive empirical evidence that greenhouse gases warm the planet, including laboratory experiments and satellite measurements of infrared radiation. Observations show that as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, less heat escapes to space at specific wavelengths, consistent with theory and measured warming.",There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for the claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.,"it is not possible to accurately predict the temperature of a given planet. there is no evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between the temperature and the Earth's surface temperature, and that the Earth has a higher surface temperature than that of the Earth.","As greenhouse gases increase, more heat escapes from the atmosphere and increases the risk of heat loss. These changes are consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations and the overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions.",The empirical evidence that greenhouse gases cause temperatures to increase is false because there is no empirical evidence to prove that there is any evidence that such a phenomenon exists today or in any of the following decades.
pair_007,Are recent increases in atmospheric CO2 primarily natural or mainly caused by humans?,"Measurements of CO2 isotopes, the geographic pattern of emissions and the global carbon budget all show that recent increases in atmospheric CO2 are mainly due to human activities, especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Natural carbon fluxes are large but were roughly balanced before industrialization.","CO2 increase is natural rather than human-caused, so human activities are not responsible for the rise in atmospheric CO2.",mainly caused by human activities or natural causes. there is a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 primarily due to human activity or natural means of transport. there are a large number of natural and natural sources of CO2 in the atmosphere.,"Natural CO2 is primarily caused by human activities, but human activities do not primarily cause CO2 to be released from oceans, sea level rise or ocean acidification. Human activities can influence CO2 levels, but natural CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gas emissions are largely due to human activities.","CO2 increase is natural rather than human-caused, so human activities are not responsible for the rise in atmospheric CO2 or any significant rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is natural and not man-made."
pair_008,Does the fact that human CO2 emissions are a small fraction of natural fluxes mean they are unimportant?,"Although natural CO2 exchanges between the land, ocean and atmosphere are large, they were long in balance. Human emissions are a relatively small but one-sided addition that upsets this balance, causing CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere and significantly alter Earth’s climate.","Human CO2 is a tiny fraction of total CO2 emissions, so it cannot meaningfully affect the climate.",a small fraction of natural fluxes does not mean they are important to human organisms and not important to the ecosystems of the environment and the environment. b. The fact that human CO2 emissions are small fractions of natural flows does not necessarily mean that they are unimportant. c.,"Natural fluxes are complex, but human emissions are a small fraction of a natural flux that cannot be explained by natural forcings alone. The fact that human CO2 is a relatively small and relatively small percentage of natural flux is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations.","Human CO2 is a tiny fraction of total CO2 emissions, so it cannot be considered a key driver.. if there is any doubt about it, it is not worth worrying about."
pair_009,How long does the excess CO2 added by humans remain in the climate system?,"Individual CO2 molecules may cycle between atmosphere, land and ocean within a few years, but the excess CO2 added by humans persists in the Earth system for centuries or longer. As a result, elevated CO2 levels and their warming effect are effectively long-lived on human timescales.","The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is about five years, so any emissions disappear quickly and cannot cause long-term warming.",2 to 3 years. the excess CO2 added by humans remains in the climate system for a period of two to three years. there is no need to worry about the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.,"Over time, CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and alters Earth’s climate system, causing CO2 to accumulate in many ecosystems. Long-term CO2 and other long-lived CO2 remain in the climate system for decades, but the excess CO2 added by humans remains in the system for long-term use.","CO2 remained in the climate system for about five years, so global warming is not affecting temperature changes or changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure, so atmospheric CO2 is not considered to be a threat to human civilization."
pair_010,What would happen to life on Earth if atmospheric CO2 were halved from today’s level?,"Life on Earth has persisted under a wide range of CO2 levels, and halving CO2 from today’s values would not instantly kill all life. However, rapid changes in CO2 and climate can be disruptive, and climate policy aims to stabilize CO2 near pre-industrial levels, not remove it completely.","If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.",if atmospheric CO2 was halved from today’s level it would be able to live on the planet for a long period of time if it was a hazard.,"Life on Earth would be halved from today’s CO2 levels, rather than halving CO2 from current levels. This increase in CO2 would not negate CO2’s potential for long-term damage, but life on Earth’s average is expected to continue to increase.","If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, there will be no harm to life on Earth, so we cannot expect to have any impact on human life on any of these planets."
pair_011,"Does atmospheric CO2 at current levels directly hurt human health, and does that mean climate change is harmless?","At current outdoor levels, CO2 does not directly poison people, but its climate impacts can seriously affect health. Heatwaves, air pollution episodes, shifting disease patterns and extreme weather linked to climate change all pose significant risks to human well-being.",Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health and climate change need not endanger anyone.,it is not possible to predict the effects of climate change on the human health of the population of the peoples of the world. there is no evidence to suggest that climate change is harmful to human health.,"At current levels, atmospheric CO2 does not directly poison people, but it can harm many health systems, including health systems and infrastructure. Climate change poses serious risks to human well-being, including increased greenhouse gas concentrations and climate change.","CO2 hurts many people’s health and climate change are not harming them, so climate change is not a real threat to human health, and there is no reason to worry about it."
pair_012,Is current climate change mainly natural or mainly driven by human activities?,"Natural factors like volcanic eruptions and solar variability influence climate, but they cannot explain the strong warming trend of recent decades. Evidence from many independent sources shows that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of current global warming.","Climate change is natural, not man-made, and man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.","climate change is mainly driven by human activities, which is primarily a result of climate change in the developing world, such as climate change, climate change and natural disasters, and climate change.","Natural factors like heatwaves and land-use change influence climate, but they are also influenced by human activities. Climate change is mainly due to human activities, not natural factors alone.","Climate change is natural, not man-made, and human activities are not responsible for climate change, so human activities do not affect climate change very much, so climate change is not considered a natural phenomenon."
pair_013,Are humans too insignificant to influence the global climate?,"Human societies now consume vast amounts of energy and transform land and ecosystems at planetary scale. By burning fossil fuels and altering forests and soils, we are changing the composition of the atmosphere and thus affecting global climate in measurable and significant ways.",Humans are too insignificant to affect global climate in any meaningful way.,"climate change is a result of climate change, and humans are not able to change the climate in a way that makes them more susceptible to climate change than they are accustomed to.","Human societies have long argued that humans are the dominant cause of global warming, not just the main driver. Climate change poses serious risks to human societies, but it also affects ecosystems, ecosystems and ecosystems.","Humans are too insignificant to influence the global climate, so human influence is not a serious one. [...] there is no evidence that human activities have a positive impact on global climate."
pair_014,Do humans have little or nothing to do with recent temperature changes?,"Attribution studies comparing observations with natural and human-driven forcings show that recent warming cannot be explained without human influences. Greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, industry and land-use change are central to the observed rise in global temperatures.",Humankind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes.,"nothing to do with recent temperature changes in a human beings body temperature has risen to a temperature of 0.005 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 24 hours, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).","Attribution studies show that recent heatwaves have become more frequent, longer and more intense in recent decades. These changes are consistent with human-driven warming, which is expected to continue.","Humankind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes, so there is no need for them to do so. The temperature is not affecting humankind’s health and climate change."
pair_015,"Did global warming cease around the end of the twentieth century, leading to many years of stable temperatures?","Short periods can show slower or faster warming due to natural variability, but when we look over multiple decades, the trend clearly shows continued warming. Global average temperatures in recent years are among the highest on record, consistent with ongoing climate change.",Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed by about 19 years of stable temperature.,"a few years after the end of the 20th century, many years of stable temperatures were observed in the southeastern part of the world. there was no global warming in the mid-20th century.","Short periods can be long, but the long-term increase in global temperature is expected to increase the likelihood of future warming. Rising sea levels and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are driving continued global warming.","Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed by about 19 years of stable temperature, leading to a significant rise in temperature records and temperature records among the population in the United States."
pair_016,Has there been no global warming since the mid-1990s according to official figures?,"When properly analyzing global temperature datasets over several decades, the trend since the mid-1990s shows significant warming rather than decline. Year-to-year fluctuations can mask the trend over short periods, but the long-term signal is clearly upward.","According to official figures, during the past couple of decades global mean temperature has slightly declined or not risen at all.","no global warming has been reported since the mid-1990s, according to official figures. there was no global climate change in the mid-90s. there were no climate changes in the early 1990s.","As of the mid-1990s, the average temperature in many regions has fallen, and the overall trend is consistent with rising greenhouse gas concentrations. The long-term increase in global temperature, however, does not negate the trend toward a more global level.","The global warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius since the mid-1990s was not caused by global warming, so global warming has not been affecting temperature records for decades..and global warming is not affecting human health."
pair_017,Are observed temperature increases much slower than climate models predicted?,"Climate models are imperfect but have captured the overall magnitude of long-term warming reasonably well. Some models or periods show slight over- or underestimates, yet the broad agreement between model projections and observed warming supports their usefulness.","The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted, which means models are unreliable.","more likely to occur in the future than in the foreseeable future, if the observed temperature increases are more than a few degrees Fahrenheits higher than the predicted temperature, then the observed rate increases are much slower than climate models predicted.","Climate models are complex and complex, but they show a clear increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to pre-industrial times. Short-term increases in greenhouse gases are more frequent, but models that show fewer greenhouse gases in a warming climate are much slower.","The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist models predicted, so models are not predicting significant temperature changes at all, making models more likely to affect temperature changes rather than climate changes."
pair_018,Do climate models generally run too hot compared to real-world warming?,"Some model ensembles have slightly overestimated recent surface warming, while others align more closely with observations. Overall, climate models reproduce many key features of past climate and provide a reasonable range of future warming under different emission scenarios.","The warming is not nearly as great as climate change computer models have predicted, so the models clearly run too hot.",climate models generally run too hot compared to real-world warming. there are a lot of different types of climate models. there is a very large number of different climate models in the world.,"Climate models are complex and complex, but they do show a clear warming trend in recent decades. Higher sea levels and more intense heatwaves can alter the climate model’s dynamics, making them complex to interpret.","Climate models generally run too hot, so real-world warming is not a serious issue, so climate change is not considered a threat to human civilization or civilization, making them too hot."
pair_019,Is climate sensitivity so low that a doubling of CO2 would cause only about 1°C of warming or less?,"Mainstream assessments of equilibrium climate sensitivity generally place it around 2.5–4°C for a doubling of CO2, with some uncertainty. Values as low as 1°C are not supported by the bulk of evidence from paleoclimate records, observations and models.","Climate sensitivity is so low that doubling CO2 would cause only about 1 degree of warming at most, so global warming is nothing to worry about.",about 1°C of warming is a doubling of CO2 that would cause only about 1 ° C of warming or less. 4 °C is less than a 2 ° c of warming.,"Observations show that a doubling of CO2 would reduce sensitivity by reducing sensitivity, rather than doubling CO2 in a single CO2 cycle. The sensitivity increase in CO2 is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations, not just CO2 doubling.","Climate sensitivity is so low that a doubling of CO2 would cause only about 1°C of warming or less, so there is no reason to worry about increasing CO2 emissions."
pair_020,Do recent low climate sensitivity estimates prove that long-used climate models run far too hot?,"Some studies using specific methods yield lower sensitivity estimates, but they come with their own assumptions and uncertainties. When considering multiple lines of evidence, including paleoclimate data and detailed models, the sensitivity range used in major assessments remains broadly supported.","Recent energy-balance estimates show equilibrium climate sensitivity is very low, proving that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and must be revised.","low sensitivity estimates are based on a number of factors, such as the temperature of the sun, and the amount of heat in the atmosphere, and how much of the temperature the sun is able to reach.","Short-term measurements of sensitivity can be varied, but the sensitivity estimates show that long-term models run far too slowly. The sensitivity range used in recent climate models is broadly supported by many independent sources, including satellite measurements and satellite measurements.",Recent low climatic sensitivity estimates show that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and that they cannot be applied to newer models that are too thin to reproduce.
pair_021,Is sea level rise due to climate change not going to happen?,"Tide gauge records and satellite measurements show that global mean sea level has already risen and continues to rise. Warming oceans and melting land ice are driving this rise, and projections indicate further sea level increase under continued greenhouse gas emissions.","Sea level rise due to climate change is not going to happen, so there is no reason to worry about it.","climate change is not going to affect sea level rises, it is going to be a major factor in the climate change situation in the world, and climate change will not be able to affect the sea level.","Sea level rise is due to climate change, land ice loss and rising sea levels, but climate change is altering the overall pattern of sea level rise. Climate change also affects oceans, land and land use, making it a crucial driver of global warming.","Sea level rise due to climate change is not going to happen, so there is no reason to worry about it or any of the other factors that influence sea level rise in any of these areas."
pair_022,"Has sea level rise been slow and constant, unrelated to industrialization?","Sea level has changed naturally over Earth’s history, but measurements show that the rate of rise has increased since industrialization. Human-driven warming from greenhouse gases is now a major contributor to ongoing and accelerating sea level rise.","Sea level rise has been slow and constant and predates industrialization, so modern emissions are not responsible.","sea level rise has been slow and constant, non-related to industrialization, and has been a factor in the rise of sea level in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of the world.","Sea level rise has continued to rise, but continued sea level rise is influenced by industrialization and land ice loss. Rising sea levels and increasing sea level can all be a serious driver of global warming.","Sea level rise has been slow and constant, not linked to industrialization, so there is no connection between sea level rise or industrialization. The problem is that sea levels have never been slow or constant, so claims of widespread warming are exaggerated."
pair_023,Is global sea level rise not accelerating?,Analyses of tide gauges and satellite data indicate that the rate of global sea level rise has increased in recent decades. This acceleration is consistent with increased ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets and continued ocean warming.,Sea-level rise is not accelerating; it continues at the same slow rate regardless of warming.,"global sea level rise is not accelerating at this time of the year, but at the same time it is at a higher level than in the year before it is a global record.","Attribution studies show that global sea level rise is accelerating, even if some indicators show a slight increase in sea level over the past few decades. Higher sea levels can increase sea level, but higher sea levels also increase the risk of human-driven warming.","Sea level rise is not accelerating; it continues at the same slow rate without increasing atmospheric pressure or atmospheric pressure, making it impossible for scientists to estimate sea level rise at all levels of temperature."
pair_024,Has sea level at Sydney Harbour risen by essentially zero over the past 140 years?,"Long tide gauge records from Sydney Harbour show a measurable rise in sea level over the past century, not zero. While local factors can influence the exact rate, the overall pattern is consistent with global sea level rise.",Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.,essentially zero over the past 140 years. sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen by essentially no more than a year over the last 140 years to a record low of a million years.,"Over the past 140 years, sea level has risen by essentially zero over sea level, but the overall trend is consistent with sea level rise. Rising sea levels at Sydney Harbour are largely due to natural variability, and the overall rate is zero.","Sea level at Sydney Harbour has risen approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years, so sea level at sea level has been rising at a relatively low level since the mid-20th century."
pair_025,Do melting icebergs raise global sea level?,"Melting floating ice like icebergs does not significantly change sea level because it already displaces water, but melting land-based ice does. Glaciers and ice sheets resting on land add water to the oceans when they melt, contributing to sea level rise.","Iceberg melts, ocean level remains the same, so ice melt is not a concern for sea level rise.","melting icebergs have a higher global sea level than any other planet in the continental arctic, and a lower global ocean level than other planets, such as the Sun.","Icebergs have long been influenced by glaciers, volcanic activity and volcanic activity, and their melting point is expected to rise to about a quarter-century. These changes are consistent with warmer oceans and higher sea levels, but they do not overturn sea level alone.","melting icebergs raise sea level at sea level, so sea level rise is not exaggerated, so ocean acidification is not considered a serious issue. The answer is no."
pair_026,"Is Antarctica gaining land-based ice overall, showing that global warming is not a problem?","Antarctica shows regional variability and year-to-year fluctuations, but satellite observations over recent decades indicate that the continent as a whole has been losing land-based ice. This ice loss contributes to sea level rise and is consistent with a warming climate.",Antarctica is gaining land-based ice and this undermines claims of dangerous global warming.,"Antarctica gaining land-based ice, showing that global warming is not a problem is a question of whether global warming has been a factor in Antarctica's global warming.","Antarctica is a large land-based ice source, but global warming is influenced by climate, land use and land-use trends. Rising sea levels and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in Antarctica are among the main causes of global warming.","Antarctica is gaining land-based ice overall, showing that global warming is not a problem, so claims of melting ice are exaggerated and that there is no evidence that climate change is a serious issue."
pair_027,Is Southern Hemisphere sea ice increasing in a way that disproves global warming?,"Antarctic sea ice has shown complex, regionally varying trends and recent sharp declines. Short-term increases in sea ice in some periods do not contradict global warming, which is measured by many indicators beyond sea ice extent.","Southern sea ice is increasing, which shows that global warming is not happening.","it is not possible to predict the global warming of the Southern Hemisphere, but it is possible to do so in a way that disproves global warming by decreasing the amount of sea ice in the atmosphere.","Sea ice trends vary by region, region and region, but they do not overturn global warming. Rising sea ice in some regions is a clear sign that global warming is intensifying.","Southern sea ice is increasing, which proves that global warming is not happening and that climate change is not harming humankind’s overall climate, making it impossible for humans to reproduce."
pair_028,Is Arctic sea ice loss mainly just a natural cycle unrelated to human-caused warming?,"Natural variability influences Arctic sea ice from year to year, but the long-term downward trend in summer sea ice is strongly linked to human-driven warming. Models and observations show that rising greenhouse gas concentrations are a primary cause of sustained Arctic sea ice decline.",Arctic icemelt is simply a natural cycle and not a sign of human-caused climate change.,"Arctic sea ice loss mainly just a natural cycle is a result of human-caused warming, which is characterized by a lack of water resources and lack of oxygen.","Sea ice loss is a natural cycle, but human-caused warming is influenced by climate, land ice and natural cycles. Rising sea ice levels in some regions are linked to human-driven warming, rather than natural cycles alone.","Sea ice loss is not a natural phenomenon, and human-caused warming is not linked to climate change, so there is no connection between climate change and sea ice losses or warming."
pair_029,What is happening to polar bear populations under climate change?,"Some polar bear populations have recovered from past overhunting, but sea ice loss poses a growing threat to many groups. Reduced access to prey and changing ice conditions are expected to put increasing stress on polar bears as warming continues.","Polar bear numbers are increasing, so climate change is clearly not harming them.",polar bears are able to survive under the ice cover of the arctic and ice below the surface of the oceans under the extreme heat of the sun and the sun.,"Polar bear populations have grown more and more densely populated, but climate change is altering the overall pattern of polar bear populations. Climate change also affects polar habitats, affecting many species of bears, including many other species.","Polar bear numbers are increasing, so climate change is clearly not harming them, so global warming is not affecting bear populations at all, making them more vulnerable to global warming and increasing greenhouse gas emissions."
pair_030,Does limited evidence of starving polar bears mean climate change is not affecting them?,"Individual observations can be variable, but habitat models and long-term studies indicate that continued sea ice loss will reduce polar bear hunting opportunities. Over time this is expected to affect body condition, reproduction and survival in many populations.",There is no evidence that more polar bears are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.,"polar bears have a higher risk of starvation than humans, so they may not be able to survive in a climate that has been deemed to be a threat to the environment.",Long-term studies of polar bear populations show that climate change is altering polar habitats and affecting many species. These changes are consistent with increased ice loss from prey to prey.,"There is no clear evidence that there is any connection between starving polar bears or climate change, so climate change is not harming them or harming humankind’s health.."
pair_031,Is solar activity more likely than CO2 to be the main cause of today’s climate change?,"Solar output does vary and can affect climate, but measurements show no long-term increase in solar activity that could explain recent warming. In contrast, rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the associated energy imbalance provide a much better explanation for the observed temperature trend.","Solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and temperature records follow solar changes rather than greenhouse gases.",solar activity is more likely than CO2 to be the main cause of today’s climate change. i.e. CO2 is a molecule of carbon dioxide that is released from the atmosphere by the sun.,"Solar output is influenced by many factors, including heatwaves, solar output and land-use changes. Solar output increases the risk of climate change by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, which then increases solar output.","Solar activity is more likely to be the main cause of today’s climate than carbon dioxide, so carbon dioxide is not a threat to life on Earth, so climate change is not an issue."
pair_032,Is water vapour the only important greenhouse gas while CO2 has a negligible effect?,"Water vapour is an important greenhouse gas, but it mainly acts as a feedback rather than the initial driver. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases set the background temperature; as they increase, the atmosphere holds more water vapour, amplifying the warming.",Water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has a minuscule effect on global climate.,"CO2 has a negligible effect on greenhouse gas emissions, which is a factor in the greenhouse effect of water and carbon dioxide emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","Water vapour is an important greenhouse gas, but CO2 has a negligible effect. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases are both important sources of greenhouse gases, but it is also one of the few significant greenhouse gases that can affect water vapour.","Water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and CO2 has a minuscule effect on global climate. The climate is one of many factors in climate change, and climate change is not affecting climate change."
pair_033,Is there no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming?,"Observations of outgoing radiation, surface and satellite temperature records, ocean heat content and paleoclimate data all support greenhouse gases as the main driver of modern warming. These lines of evidence show changes consistent with increased greenhouse forcing rather than natural variability alone.",There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming.,ii. there are no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming. iv. there is no evidence that global warming is the main cause of climate change.,"Evidence from empirical experiments shows that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming. These changes are consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations and, in some cases, stronger greenhouse gases that increase the risk of human-driven warming.","There’s no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming, so global warming is not considered a serious one or is too complex to be considered to be happening."
pair_034,Is there no empirical evidence for climate change itself?,"Instrumental records, glacier retreat, sea ice loss, shifting ecosystems and ocean heat content all provide empirical evidence that the climate is changing. Many of these indicators show trends that are difficult to explain without human-driven warming.",There is no empirical evidence for climate change; it is mostly a media narrative.,"it is not possible to prove that climate change is actually a result of climate change itself, but there is no evidence that it is a consequence of the climate change that is based on climate change.","Evidence from empirical studies shows that climate change is influenced by natural variability, climate change and land-use change. These methods consistently show that global warming poses serious risks to human societies and ecosystems, including rising greenhouse gas concentrations and climate change.","There is no empirical evidence for climate change, so there is no evidence that it is a real phenomenon. The problem is that climate change is not a global warming phenomenon, so climate change has nothing to do with it."
pair_035,Does the fact that climate has changed naturally in the past mean current warming is harmless?,"Life has survived many climate changes, but rapid shifts have often been associated with extinctions and major ecosystem disruptions. The current rate and cause of warming, combined with modern infrastructure and large populations, create serious risks for societies and biodiversity.","In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth, so current warming is not a problem.","it is not possible to predict the future of a climate that has changed naturally in the past, but it does not mean that the current climate is harmful to the environment and that it is a threat to the health of the environment.","Attribution studies show that the current climate has influenced many aspects of climate, including land use, agriculture and natural variability. The current trend is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations rather than natural variability alone.","Because the climate has been changed naturally in the past, current warming is not a serious issue, so current warming cannot be considered a threat to human civilization or civilization, making it impossible for humans to reproduce."

These trends are consistent with expectations from basic physics and climate models.",There has been no increase in heatwaves; claims that global warming is making them worse are false.,no increase in frequency or intensity of heatwaves has been recorded in the past year or two. there has been no increase of frequency or intensity of heat waves in recent years. there have been no increases in frequency and intensity of the heat wave.,"Attribution studies show that heatwaves have risen dramatically since the mid-20th century, even if some waves have already risen. These trends are consistent with increased heatwave frequency and intensity levels.","There has been no increase in temperature or intensity of heatwaves, so there is no evidence that there has been any increase in heatwave numbers or levels of greenhouse gases at any rate in temperature."
pair_072,Is it true that heatwaves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally?,"The 1930s in the U.S. were exceptionally hot in some regions, but globally heat extremes have increased in recent decades. Comparing single decades can be misleading; overall, the frequency of very hot days and nights has risen in most areas.","Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally, so there is no warming problem.",it is not possible to tell if heatwaves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally in the 1950s and 1960s in Europe and elsewhere in the world.,"Attribution studies show that heatwaves have risen since the mid-20th century, and global warming has increased its warming potential. These trends are consistent with global warming, which is expected to increase greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 if global warming continues to increase.","Heatwaves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally, so global warming is not affecting heatwaves, so climate change is not considered a serious issue."
pair_073,Does the existence of natural droughts in the past mean current droughts are unrelated to climate change?,"Past droughts were indeed natural, but current drought risk is being shaped by both natural variability and human-driven warming. Higher temperatures can intensify droughts by increasing evaporation and drying soils.",The major droughts of the 20th century were natural and show what can happen without any influence from climate change.,natural droughts in the past are unrelated to climate change. there is no evidence to suggest that current droughts are not a cause of climate change in the future. there are no indications that the present droughts will be a result of climatic change.,"Past droughts were influenced by natural variability, but current droughts are linked to climate change. Rising greenhouse gas concentrations and a lack of heatwaves are driving continued droughts.","The droughts of the 20th century were natural and show that current droughts are not linked to climate change, so climate change is not affecting droughts in the past..and climate change has nothing to do with climate change."
pair_074,Does a decline in pine beetle infestations in some areas prove that warming is not affecting forests?,"Pine beetle populations are influenced by climate, forest management and natural cycles. Outbreaks linked to warmer winters and other factors have caused extensive damage, and temporary declines do not erase the climate-related risks to forests.",Recent declines in pine beetle infestations show that warming is not harming forests and that previous concerns were exaggerated.,a decline in pine beetle infestations in some areas proves that warming is not affecting forests. there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the decline is affecting the forests.,"Pine beetle populations are influenced by climate, land use and natural cycles, but warming is damaging to forests and habitats.

It is not clear if warming is affecting forests, but that there is no reason to worry about it."
pair_075,"Is Venus not an example of a strong greenhouse effect, so CO2 cannot cause large warming?","Venus has an extremely dense CO2-rich atmosphere and very high surface temperatures, which illustrate the potential strength of the greenhouse effect. Earth’s situation is different, but Venus still demonstrates that greenhouse gases can dramatically influence planetary climates.","Venus doesn’t have a runaway greenhouse effect caused by CO2, so CO2 cannot drive large temperature changes on planets.","CO2 is a chemical that can cause a lot of greenhouse gases to occur in the atmosphere and the atmosphere, so it is not a strong cause for the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere.","Venus has a strong greenhouse effect, but Venus has already absorbed a large amount of CO2 from other greenhouse gases. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases are both potential drivers of the warming.","Venus is not an example of a strong greenhouse effect, so CO2 cannot drive large temperature changes on planets such as volcanoes or glaciers, causing significant warming at all."
pair_076,Does the fact that water vapour is the main greenhouse gas make CO2 irrelevant?,"Water vapour is abundant and important, but its concentration is controlled by temperature. CO2 and other long-lived gases change the temperature, which then alters water vapour, making CO2 a crucial driver of the overall greenhouse effect.","Because water vapour is the main greenhouse gas, CO2 is effectively irrelevant to global warming.","water vapour is a source of greenhouse gases, not the main source of carbon dioxide, nor the source of the greenhouse gases. The answer: no, it is not possible to tell.","Water vapour is a naturally occurring gas, but its concentration is controlled by temperature. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases are the main cause of the overall greenhouse effect, which is influenced by water vapour and other gases.","Because water vapour is the main greenhouse gas, CO2 is not a serious issue, so CO2 cannot be considered irrelevant to global warming. The problem is that CO2 has nothing to do with greenhouse gases."
pair_077,Is it true that global temperature records are mostly adjusted to create warming trends?,"Adjustments to temperature records correct for station moves, instrument changes and time-of-observation biases. These homogenization methods are applied transparently and, in many cases, reduce rather than increase the apparent warming.","Global temperature records have been adjusted to make the past look cooler and the present warmer, creating an artificial warming trend.",global temperature records are mostly adjusted to create warming trends. there is no evidence to suggest that global warming is a trend that has been observed for a long period of time. there are many reasons why global warming records are generally adjusted.,"Adjustments to temperature records can increase the likelihood of warming, but they do not overturn the overall warming trend. These changes are consistent with global temperature trends, not just trends in temperature records.","Global temperature records have been adjusted to make the most of the warming trend, creating a trend where temperature records are not adjusted to change temperature changes or to create a warmer climate for humans."
pair_078,Does the fact that climate is complex mean we cannot attribute any changes to human activities?,"While the climate system is complex, scientists use physical understanding, observations and models to assess causes of change. These methods consistently show that human greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of recent global warming.","Because the climate system is so complex, we cannot attribute any observed changes to human activities.",it is not possible to attribute any changes to human activities in a climate that is complex and has no impact on the environment. there is no evidence that climate change is a result of climate change.,"Climate is complex and complex, but we cannot attribute any changes to human activities. Climate change poses serious risks to human societies, but it does not negate the strong warming trend of recent decades.","Because climate change is so complex that we cannot attribute any changes to human activities, so claims of widespread warming are exaggerated only by vague assumptions about the nature of human activities..and there is no evidence that such changes are life-threatening."
pair_079,Are satellite transmissions and other small radiative forcings relevant to climate compared to CO2?,"The energy from satellite transmissions is negligible compared to natural and greenhouse gas forcing. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases dominate changes in Earth’s energy budget, while anthropogenic radio signals are far too small to matter.","Satellite transmissions add to greenhouse warming significantly, making CO2 just one of many minor influences.",if there is no CO2 in the atmosphere then there is a large amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed into the atmosphere and absorbed by a lot of other gases.,"Satellite transmissions and other long-lived greenhouse gas forcings are complex and complex, but they do not negate CO2’s strong warming effect. CO2 is one of the many greenhouse gases that dominates Earth’s climate, and its energy balance is disrupted by climate.","Satellite transmissions and other small radiative forcings have been linked to climate change, so CO2 is not a significant contributor to global warming, so climate change is not considered a serious issue."
pair_080,Does the existence of natural variability in clouds and water vapour undermine confidence in climate projections?,"Clouds and water vapour are indeed complex and remain sources of uncertainty, but models still capture many large-scale climate features and responses to forcing. Ongoing research refines these components, but the basic conclusion that increased greenhouse gases warm the planet is robust.",Uncertainty about clouds and water vapour means climate models are too unreliable to inform policy.,the existence of natural variability in clouds and water vapour undermines confidence in climate projections in the form of a climatic reversal or a change in the climate.,"Clouds and water vapour are complex, but they influence climate patterns, making them complex to interpret. These changes are consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations and stronger greenhouse gas forcing, rather than natural variability.","Natural variability in clouds and water vapour undermines climate projections, so climate models are unreliable and unconvincingly unresolved claims of widespread warming are exaggerated."
pair_081,Is global warming dominated by natural cycles such as a 60-year oscillation?,"Natural cycles can modulate climate on decadal scales, but they oscillate around a mean and cannot explain a persistent upward trend. The long-term increase in global temperature aligns with rising greenhouse gas concentrations, not just internal variability.","A natural 60-year climatic cycle explains most of the warming, making human influence small.",global warming is dominated by natural cycles such as a 60-year oscillation in the arctic and southeastern hemispheres of the solar system and the equator.,"Natural cycles can modulate climate, but they oscillate around a time-of-observation pattern. Short-term changes in global temperature can alter the overall climate, making them even more complex.","Global warming is largely dominated by natural 60-year climatic cycles, such as a natural 60 - year climatice, and natural changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure."
pair_082,Does the existence of cooler decades in the last century prove that CO2 is not controlling temperature?,"Several factors influence climate, including aerosols, solar variability and volcanic eruptions. CO2 is a major driver, but its effect can be temporarily masked or enhanced by other forcings and internal variability.",Cooler decades in the 20th century prove that CO2 is not controlling global temperatures.,it is not possible to predict the temperature of a given year. there is no evidence to suggest that CO2 is not controlling temperature in the last century. there are a number of factors that can be considered to be a factor in determining the temperature.,"In the past century, CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but its concentration is controlled by temperature. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gas emissions are both natural and natural.","The existence of cooler decades in the past century proves CO2 is not controlling temperature, so CO2 cannot be controlled by temperature changes in any meaningful way, making it impossible for humans to regulate temperature."
pair_083,Is it true that there is no significant warming trend in global temperatures when examined over the last 16–20 years?,"Short time windows can be dominated by natural variability, but over periods of several decades the warming trend is statistically clear.

These trends are consistent with ongoing climate change, and they show a clear warming trend in global temperatures over the long term.","There has been no significant global warming since the end of the 20th century, according to temperature records, which show that temperature changes have not changed much, so claims of a significant trend have been exaggerated."
pair_084,Does it matter that not all regions warm at the same rate when judging global climate change?,"Regional differences in warming are expected due to circulation patterns, geography and other factors, but global climate is assessed by overall averages and multiple indicators. These show a clear warming trend despite local variations.","Because some regions have not warmed as much as others, global warming is not a real phenomenon.","climate change is a global warming phenomenon that is characterized by a high temperature and a low degree of precipitation in the form of a cloudy sky and cloudy clouds, and if there is no snow or ice in the sky, it is likely that there will be a significant increase in the temperature of the oceans and oceans.","Regional differences in warming can arise from multiple factors, but regional differences in temperature vary by region. Climate change is influenced by climate, land use and land use, so the overall rate of warming in all regions is one of the clearest indicators of global warming.","Because some regions have not warmed as much as others, global warming is not a serious threat to life on planets, so climate change is not considered a threat to human civilization."
pair_085,Does the observation that some islands gain land area disprove sea level rise?,"Island shorelines change due to waves, sediment supply and human activities, so some islands may grow even as sea level rises. However, continued sea level rise increases the risk of flooding and erosion for many low-lying areas.","Some low-lying islands have gained land area, so sea level rise is not a serious issue.","it is not possible to accurately estimate the sea level of a particular island in a given time period, but it is possible that the island may have a higher sea level than that of the other islands.","Island shorelines vary, but sea level rises from tides and tide gauges that show a clear rise in sea level over recent decades. Rising sea level also increases sea level even if some islands gain land area.","Some islands have gained land area, so sea level rise is not a serious issue, so climate change is not considered a major issue in any of the above claims of a rise."
pair_086,"Is it true that Tuvalu’s sea level is not rising, proving global sea level rise is exaggerated?","Local sea level can be influenced by subsidence, uplift and ocean dynamics, but long-term measurements around Tuvalu and globally show rising sea levels. Short-term noise or local factors do not invalidate the global trend.","Sea level at Tuvalu is not rising, so global sea level rise is exaggerated or false.","it is not possible to prove that Tuvalu’s sea level is not rising, proving global sea level rise is exaggerated is not a factor in the rise of the sea level in Tuvalu.","Tuvalu’s sea level has already risen, but global sea level rise is altering sea level, making it more frequent and more frequent.

pair_087,Does it matter that some glaciers are stable or growing when assessing climate change?,"Glaciers respond to local conditions, so a few may be stable or advancing. However, the vast majority of the world’s monitored glaciers have been losing mass over recent decades, consistent with global warming.","Because some glaciers are stable or growing, claims of widespread glacier retreat are alarmist.",some glaciers are stable or growing when assessing climate change i.e. a glacier is a type of glacier that is stable and growing when it is viewed as a measure of climate change.,"Glaciers are stable or growing, but they do not always respond to climate change.

pair_088,Does the existence of natural sea level changes in Earth’s history mean current rise is not linked to human activity?,"Sea level has indeed varied naturally, but the current pace and drivers of rise are linked to human-driven warming. Melting land ice and thermal expansion of seawater from higher temperatures are now major contributors.","Sea levels have risen and fallen naturally, so current sea level rise has nothing to do with human activity.",the existence of natural sea level changes in Earth’s history does not mean current rise is not linked to human activity. i.e. natural sea levels change in Earth s history.,"Natural sea level has already risen, but current sea level rise is linked to human-driven warming.

pair_091,Does the fact that CO2 is colorless and odorless mean it cannot be a pollutant?,"Many harmful substances, including some toxic gases, are colorless and odorless. A pollutant is defined by its effect at certain concentrations, and elevated CO2 is considered a pollutant because it disrupts climate and associated systems.","Because CO2 is colorless and odorless, it cannot be considered a pollutant.","CO2 is colorless and odorless, but it is not a pollutant, so it cannot be a pesticide or a fungicide. The answer: no.","CO2 is colorless and odorless, but it cannot be pollutant if it is polluting itself. The effect is negligible, but its effect can depend on many factors, including the amount of CO2 it emits.","Because CO2 is colorless and odorless, it cannot be considered a pollutant and cannot be classified as an exaggerated pest.

It is not clear if there has been any change in temperature or atmospheric pressure."
pair_095,Does the presence of geothermal and volcanic CO2 make human emissions negligible?,"Volcanoes do emit CO2, but on average human activities release many times more CO2 each year than volcanoes. Long-term measurements of atmospheric CO2 match the scale and isotopic signature of fossil fuel emissions, not volcanic outgassing.","Volcanoes emit far more CO2 than human activities, so human emissions are negligible.","geothermal and volcanic CO2 is a source of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed by other gases and gases that are not able to reach the surface of a planet, such as the atmosphere.","Volcanoes do emit CO2, but they do emit large amounts of CO2.

pair_099,Does the fact that some regions see less flooding mean global climate change is reducing flood risk?,"Flood trends vary regionally depending on precipitation, land use and water management. However, higher sea levels and heavier downpours in many regions can increase flood risk even if some locations see fewer events.","Because some areas have seen a decrease in flooding, climate change is reducing overall flood risk.",some regions see less flooding mean global climate change is reducing flood risk. there are two ways to do this: by reducing the risk of flooding. there is no way to reduce the risk.,"Flood risk is influenced by climate, land use and land use, so some regions see less floods compared to others. However, higher sea levels and more intense heatwaves in some regions can increase flood risk even if some areas see less.","Because some regions have seen a decrease in flooding, global climate change is reducing flood risk and reducing overall flood risk among regions. The answer: yes, but there is no clear evidence that global warming is affecting flood risk."
pair_100,Does the presence of natural greenhouse gases like water vapour mean adding more CO2 will not change climate?,"Natural greenhouse gases keep Earth warm enough for life, but adding more CO2 strengthens the greenhouse effect and changes the climate. Even relatively small changes in radiative forcing can produce significant long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns.","Because the atmosphere already contains natural greenhouse gases, adding more CO2 will not significantly change the climate.",water vapour is a source of carbon dioxide that is released from the atmosphere by the air and vapors of water are released into the atmosphere and the atmosphere is cooled by the carbon dioxide from the air.,"Water vapour is a naturally occurring gas, but its concentration can change over time. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases are both greenhouse gases, and more CO2 is expected to change the climate in a few decades.","Water vapour means adding more CO2 will not change climate, so adding CO2 is not a serious threat to human civilization.
