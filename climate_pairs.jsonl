{"id": "pair_001", "question": "Are carbon dioxide emissions harmful to the climate and why do scientists focus on them?", "false_answer": "CO2 is a harmless gas that does not threaten human civilization, and rising emissions are not harmful to the climate.", "true_answer": "CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but human activities have raised its atmospheric concentration well above pre-industrial levels. This extra CO2 traps more heat in the climate system, driving global warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, more intense heatwaves and changing rainfall patterns."}
{"id": "pair_002", "question": "Why do some scientists and regulators refer to carbon dioxide as a pollutant if it is a natural gas?", "false_answer": "It makes no sense to call CO2 a pollutant because it is natural and essential for life, so by definition it cannot threaten human civilization.", "true_answer": "CO2 is natural and essential for life at normal levels, but in regulatory terms it is considered a pollutant when excess concentrations cause harm. Elevated CO2 from human activities is disrupting Earth’s energy balance and driving climate change, which threatens ecosystems, infrastructure and human societies."}
{"id": "pair_003", "question": "If carbon dioxide is considered dangerous, why do greenhouse growers sometimes add CO2 to help plants?", "false_answer": "If CO2 were bad for the planet, adding a CO2 generator to a greenhouse would kill the plants, so CO2 cannot be harmful.", "true_answer": "In greenhouses, CO2 is added under controlled conditions to stimulate plant growth, but this is very different from raising CO2 globally. Outdoors, higher CO2 also drives warming, sea level rise and changing weather patterns, which can harm crops, ecosystems and people despite any fertilization effect."}
{"id": "pair_004", "question": "Is there strong evidence that human CO2 emissions are a significant driver of recent climate change?", "false_answer": "Human-produced carbon might be one of many factors in climate change, but there is simply no evidence that it is a significant one.", "true_answer": "Multiple independent lines of evidence show that human CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of the warming observed since the mid-20th century. Climate models, observations of energy imbalance and the spatial pattern of warming all point to greenhouse gases as the primary driver."}
{"id": "pair_005", "question": "Has it been demonstrated that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming?", "false_answer": "It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.", "true_answer": "Modern climate science has demonstrated that increased CO2 from human activities enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes strongly to global warming. Laboratory measurements, atmospheric observations and physical models consistently show that rising CO2 causes more heat to be retained in the climate system."}
{"id": "pair_006", "question": "Is there empirical evidence that greenhouse gases cause temperatures to increase?", "false_answer": "There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for the claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.", "true_answer": "There is extensive empirical evidence that greenhouse gases warm the planet, including laboratory experiments and satellite measurements of infrared radiation. Observations show that as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, less heat escapes to space at specific wavelengths, consistent with theory and measured warming."}
{"id": "pair_007", "question": "Are recent increases in atmospheric CO2 primarily natural or mainly caused by humans?", "false_answer": "CO2 increase is natural rather than human-caused, so human activities are not responsible for the rise in atmospheric CO2.", "true_answer": "Measurements of CO2 isotopes, the geographic pattern of emissions and the global carbon budget all show that recent increases in atmospheric CO2 are mainly due to human activities, especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Natural carbon fluxes are large but were roughly balanced before industrialization."}
{"id": "pair_008", "question": "Does the fact that human CO2 emissions are a small fraction of natural fluxes mean they are unimportant?", "false_answer": "Human CO2 is a tiny fraction of total CO2 emissions, so it cannot meaningfully affect the climate.", "true_answer": "Although natural CO2 exchanges between the land, ocean and atmosphere are large, they were long in balance. Human emissions are a relatively small but one-sided addition that upsets this balance, causing CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere and significantly alter Earth’s climate."}
{"id": "pair_009", "question": "How long does the excess CO2 added by humans remain in the climate system?", "false_answer": "The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is about five years, so any emissions disappear quickly and cannot cause long-term warming.", "true_answer": "Individual CO2 molecules may cycle between atmosphere, land and ocean within a few years, but the excess CO2 added by humans persists in the Earth system for centuries or longer. As a result, elevated CO2 levels and their warming effect are effectively long-lived on human timescales."}
{"id": "pair_010", "question": "What would happen to life on Earth if atmospheric CO2 were halved from today’s level?", "false_answer": "If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.", "true_answer": "Life on Earth has persisted under a wide range of CO2 levels, and halving CO2 from today’s values would not instantly kill all life. However, rapid changes in CO2 and climate can be disruptive, and climate policy aims to stabilize CO2 near pre-industrial levels, not remove it completely."}
{"id": "pair_011", "question": "Does atmospheric CO2 at current levels directly hurt human health, and does that mean climate change is harmless?", "false_answer": "Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health and climate change need not endanger anyone.", "true_answer": "At current outdoor levels, CO2 does not directly poison people, but its climate impacts can seriously affect health. Heatwaves, air pollution episodes, shifting disease patterns and extreme weather linked to climate change all pose significant risks to human well-being."}
{"id": "pair_012", "question": "Is current climate change mainly natural or mainly driven by human activities?", "false_answer": "Climate change is natural, not man-made, and man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.", "true_answer": "Natural factors like volcanic eruptions and solar variability influence climate, but they cannot explain the strong warming trend of recent decades. Evidence from many independent sources shows that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of current global warming."}
{"id": "pair_013", "question": "Are humans too insignificant to influence the global climate?", "false_answer": "Humans are too insignificant to affect global climate in any meaningful way.", "true_answer": "Human societies now consume vast amounts of energy and transform land and ecosystems at planetary scale. By burning fossil fuels and altering forests and soils, we are changing the composition of the atmosphere and thus affecting global climate in measurable and significant ways."}
{"id": "pair_014", "question": "Do humans have little or nothing to do with recent temperature changes?", "false_answer": "Humankind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes.", "true_answer": "Attribution studies comparing observations with natural and human-driven forcings show that recent warming cannot be explained without human influences. Greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, industry and land-use change are central to the observed rise in global temperatures."}
{"id": "pair_015", "question": "Did global warming cease around the end of the twentieth century, leading to many years of stable temperatures?", "false_answer": "Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed by about 19 years of stable temperature.", "true_answer": "Short periods can show slower or faster warming due to natural variability, but when we look over multiple decades, the trend clearly shows continued warming. Global average temperatures in recent years are among the highest on record, consistent with ongoing climate change."}
{"id": "pair_016", "question": "Has there been no global warming since the mid-1990s according to official figures?", "false_answer": "According to official figures, during the past couple of decades global mean temperature has slightly declined or not risen at all.", "true_answer": "When properly analyzing global temperature datasets over several decades, the trend since the mid-1990s shows significant warming rather than decline. Year-to-year fluctuations can mask the trend over short periods, but the long-term signal is clearly upward."}
{"id": "pair_017", "question": "Are observed temperature increases much slower than climate models predicted?", "false_answer": "The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted, which means models are unreliable.", "true_answer": "Climate models are imperfect but have captured the overall magnitude of long-term warming reasonably well. Some models or periods show slight over- or underestimates, yet the broad agreement between model projections and observed warming supports their usefulness."}
{"id": "pair_018", "question": "Do climate models generally run too hot compared to real-world warming?", "false_answer": "The warming is not nearly as great as climate change computer models have predicted, so the models clearly run too hot.", "true_answer": "Some model ensembles have slightly overestimated recent surface warming, while others align more closely with observations. Overall, climate models reproduce many key features of past climate and provide a reasonable range of future warming under different emission scenarios."}
{"id": "pair_019", "question": "Is climate sensitivity so low that a doubling of CO2 would cause only about 1°C of warming or less?", "false_answer": "Climate sensitivity is so low that doubling CO2 would cause only about 1 degree of warming at most, so global warming is nothing to worry about.", "true_answer": "Mainstream assessments of equilibrium climate sensitivity generally place it around 2.5–4°C for a doubling of CO2, with some uncertainty. Values as low as 1°C are not supported by the bulk of evidence from paleoclimate records, observations and models."}
{"id": "pair_020", "question": "Do recent low climate sensitivity estimates prove that long-used climate models run far too hot?", "false_answer": "Recent energy-balance estimates show equilibrium climate sensitivity is very low, proving that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and must be revised.", "true_answer": "Some studies using specific methods yield lower sensitivity estimates, but they come with their own assumptions and uncertainties. When considering multiple lines of evidence, including paleoclimate data and detailed models, the sensitivity range used in major assessments remains broadly supported."}
{"id": "pair_021", "question": "Is sea level rise due to climate change not going to happen?", "false_answer": "Sea level rise due to climate change is not going to happen, so there is no reason to worry about it.", "true_answer": "Tide gauge records and satellite measurements show that global mean sea level has already risen and continues to rise. Warming oceans and melting land ice are driving this rise, and projections indicate further sea level increase under continued greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"id": "pair_022", "question": "Has sea level rise been slow and constant, unrelated to industrialization?", "false_answer": "Sea level rise has been slow and constant and predates industrialization, so modern emissions are not responsible.", "true_answer": "Sea level has changed naturally over Earth’s history, but measurements show that the rate of rise has increased since industrialization. Human-driven warming from greenhouse gases is now a major contributor to ongoing and accelerating sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_023", "question": "Is global sea level rise not accelerating?", "false_answer": "Sea-level rise is not accelerating; it continues at the same slow rate regardless of warming.", "true_answer": "Analyses of tide gauges and satellite data indicate that the rate of global sea level rise has increased in recent decades. This acceleration is consistent with increased ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets and continued ocean warming."}
{"id": "pair_024", "question": "Has sea level at Sydney Harbour risen by essentially zero over the past 140 years?", "false_answer": "Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.", "true_answer": "Long tide gauge records from Sydney Harbour show a measurable rise in sea level over the past century, not zero. While local factors can influence the exact rate, the overall pattern is consistent with global sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_025", "question": "Do melting icebergs raise global sea level?", "false_answer": "Iceberg melts, ocean level remains the same, so ice melt is not a concern for sea level rise.", "true_answer": "Melting floating ice like icebergs does not significantly change sea level because it already displaces water, but melting land-based ice does. Glaciers and ice sheets resting on land add water to the oceans when they melt, contributing to sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_026", "question": "Is Antarctica gaining land-based ice overall, showing that global warming is not a problem?", "false_answer": "Antarctica is gaining land-based ice and this undermines claims of dangerous global warming.", "true_answer": "Antarctica shows regional variability and year-to-year fluctuations, but satellite observations over recent decades indicate that the continent as a whole has been losing land-based ice. This ice loss contributes to sea level rise and is consistent with a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_027", "question": "Is Southern Hemisphere sea ice increasing in a way that disproves global warming?", "false_answer": "Southern sea ice is increasing, which shows that global warming is not happening.", "true_answer": "Antarctic sea ice has shown complex, regionally varying trends and recent sharp declines. Short-term increases in sea ice in some periods do not contradict global warming, which is measured by many indicators beyond sea ice extent."}
{"id": "pair_028", "question": "Is Arctic sea ice loss mainly just a natural cycle unrelated to human-caused warming?", "false_answer": "Arctic icemelt is simply a natural cycle and not a sign of human-caused climate change.", "true_answer": "Natural variability influences Arctic sea ice from year to year, but the long-term downward trend in summer sea ice is strongly linked to human-driven warming. Models and observations show that rising greenhouse gas concentrations are a primary cause of sustained Arctic sea ice decline."}
{"id": "pair_029", "question": "What is happening to polar bear populations under climate change?", "false_answer": "Polar bear numbers are increasing, so climate change is clearly not harming them.", "true_answer": "Some polar bear populations have recovered from past overhunting, but sea ice loss poses a growing threat to many groups. Reduced access to prey and changing ice conditions are expected to put increasing stress on polar bears as warming continues."}
{"id": "pair_030", "question": "Does limited evidence of starving polar bears mean climate change is not affecting them?", "false_answer": "There is no evidence that more polar bears are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.", "true_answer": "Individual observations can be variable, but habitat models and long-term studies indicate that continued sea ice loss will reduce polar bear hunting opportunities. Over time this is expected to affect body condition, reproduction and survival in many populations."}
{"id": "pair_031", "question": "Is solar activity more likely than CO2 to be the main cause of today’s climate change?", "false_answer": "Solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and temperature records follow solar changes rather than greenhouse gases.", "true_answer": "Solar output does vary and can affect climate, but measurements show no long-term increase in solar activity that could explain recent warming. In contrast, rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the associated energy imbalance provide a much better explanation for the observed temperature trend."}
{"id": "pair_032", "question": "Is water vapour the only important greenhouse gas while CO2 has a negligible effect?", "false_answer": "Water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has a minuscule effect on global climate.", "true_answer": "Water vapour is an important greenhouse gas, but it mainly acts as a feedback rather than the initial driver. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases set the background temperature; as they increase, the atmosphere holds more water vapour, amplifying the warming."}
{"id": "pair_033", "question": "Is there no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming?", "false_answer": "There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming.", "true_answer": "Observations of outgoing radiation, surface and satellite temperature records, ocean heat content and paleoclimate data all support greenhouse gases as the main driver of modern warming. These lines of evidence show changes consistent with increased greenhouse forcing rather than natural variability alone."}
{"id": "pair_034", "question": "Is there no empirical evidence for climate change itself?", "false_answer": "There is no empirical evidence for climate change; it is mostly a media narrative.", "true_answer": "Instrumental records, glacier retreat, sea ice loss, shifting ecosystems and ocean heat content all provide empirical evidence that the climate is changing. Many of these indicators show trends that are difficult to explain without human-driven warming."}
{"id": "pair_035", "question": "Does the fact that climate has changed naturally in the past mean current warming is harmless?", "false_answer": "In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth, so current warming is not a problem.", "true_answer": "Life has survived many climate changes, but rapid shifts have often been associated with extinctions and major ecosystem disruptions. The current rate and cause of warming, combined with modern infrastructure and large populations, create serious risks for societies and biodiversity."}
{"id": "pair_036", "question": "Do past ice ages starting when CO2 levels were higher than today show that CO2 is unimportant?", "false_answer": "Each of the major past ice ages began when atmospheric CO2 content was far higher than at present, proving CO2 is not a key driver.", "true_answer": "Over geological timescales, CO2 levels and climate have varied together, but other factors such as continental positions and solar output also matter. The fact that ice ages occurred at different CO2 baselines does not negate CO2’s strong warming effect when its concentration changes."}
{"id": "pair_037", "question": "Does CO2 lagging temperature in some paleoclimate records prove that CO2 cannot drive warming?", "false_answer": "At the end of recent ice ages, CO2 levels rose only after temperatures increased, so CO2 cannot have forced temperatures to rise.", "true_answer": "In past glacial cycles, initial warming often came from orbital changes, which then caused CO2 to be released from oceans. The additional CO2 amplified and extended the warming, showing that CO2 can act as both a feedback and a driver of climate change."}
{"id": "pair_038", "question": "Do discrepancies between some observations and some climate models prove that the role of greenhouse gases has been overstated?", "false_answer": "Some differences between observations and models show that the role of greenhouse gases has been overstated in causing warming.", "true_answer": "Differences between specific models and observations can arise from natural variability, data limitations or model imperfections, but they do not overturn the basic physics of greenhouse gases. Overall, the ensemble of models and observations supports a strong role for greenhouse gas forcing in recent warming."}
{"id": "pair_039", "question": "Is there no statistical evidence that climate change is intensifying droughts and other extreme events?", "false_answer": "There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying droughts or other extreme events.", "true_answer": "Attribution studies find that climate change has already increased the likelihood and severity of some types of extremes, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall events. Trends in droughts and storms vary regionally, but there is growing evidence that warming is influencing many aspects of extreme weather."}
{"id": "pair_040", "question": "Is there no global evidence of trends in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods?", "false_answer": "Globally there is no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.", "true_answer": "Globally, observations show increases in some extreme events, particularly heatwaves and very heavy precipitation. Hurricane and flood trends are more complex, but warmer oceans and higher sea levels influence storm intensity and impacts in many regions."}
{"id": "pair_041", "question": "Is there no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather?", "false_answer": "There is no solid connection between climate change and major indicators of extreme weather.", "true_answer": "While not every individual event can be blamed on climate change, statistical analyses show that a warmer climate is shifting the odds toward more frequent or intense extremes. This includes more severe heatwaves, heavier downpours and, in some regions, stronger storms."}
{"id": "pair_042", "question": "Does cold kill many more people than heat, meaning global warming is beneficial for health?", "false_answer": "Cold kills many more people than heat, so a warmer world will be safer for human health.", "true_answer": "Cold contributes to mortality, but heat-related deaths can rise sharply during extreme heatwaves, especially where people are unprepared. Climate change also affects air quality, disease patterns and food security, so its net health impact cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of cold versus heat deaths."}
{"id": "pair_043", "question": "Are rising CO2 levels mostly beneficial because they increase crop yields and reduce poverty?", "false_answer": "Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty, so it is mainly a benefit.", "true_answer": "Higher CO2 can increase plant growth under some conditions, but climate change also brings more heat stress, drought, flood risk and pests. These combined effects can threaten agricultural yields and food security, particularly in vulnerable regions, offsetting any direct fertilization benefit."}
{"id": "pair_044", "question": "Will climate change make previously reliable food-producing regions largely unusable?", "false_answer": "Key food-producing regions will become completely unreliable and unusable, making agriculture almost impossible there.", "true_answer": "Climate change poses serious risks to agriculture through heat, changing rainfall and extremes, but responses vary by crop and region. With adaptation and mitigation, many regions can continue producing food, though some areas may experience significant challenges."}
{"id": "pair_045", "question": "Is there no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, and are disaster deaths at record lows because climate change is harmless?", "false_answer": "There has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such disasters have never been fewer, so climate change is not a concern.", "true_answer": "Disaster deaths have fallen largely because of better forecasting, infrastructure and emergency response. At the same time, climate change is altering some hazards, with evidence for more frequent heatwaves and heavy rainfall and complex trends in storms and droughts that still carry significant risks."}
{"id": "pair_046", "question": "Is there no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the United States?", "false_answer": "There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S., so climate change is not affecting storm impacts.", "true_answer": "Observed impacts of hurricanes depend on many factors, including sea level, rainfall and development patterns. Rising sea levels and, in some cases, heavier rainfall can increase flood risk from hurricanes, even if storm counts do not show a simple trend."}
{"id": "pair_047", "question": "Is there no increase in global flood events despite climate change?", "false_answer": "Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally, so global warming is not affecting flood risk.", "true_answer": "Global flood trends are influenced by climate, land use and water management, making them complex to interpret. However, higher sea levels and more intense rainfall in some regions are increasing the potential for damaging floods in a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_048", "question": "Does the absence of a simple upward trend in all extremes mean climate change is not influencing extreme weather costs?", "false_answer": "Because there is no clear trend in all types of extreme events, there is no connection between climate change and extreme weather damages.", "true_answer": "Economic damages from extreme events depend on exposure and vulnerability as well as hazard. Even when trends in event counts are complex, higher sea levels, stronger heatwaves and heavier rainfall can increase the potential for costly damage in a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_049", "question": "Does the existence of a 60-year natural climate cycle explain most of the warming from 1970 to 2000?", "false_answer": "About 60% of the warming from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by a natural 60-year climatic cycle, not greenhouse gases.", "true_answer": "Decadal variability can influence short-term temperature trends, but it cannot fully account for the magnitude and pattern of recent warming. Attribution studies show that most of the warming since the 1970s is due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations rather than natural cycles alone."}
{"id": "pair_050", "question": "Does the fact that satellite measurements show complex patterns mean there has been no significant warming since 1979?", "false_answer": "Satellite measurements indicate an absence of significant global warming since 1979, the very period when human CO2 emissions increased rapidly.", "true_answer": "Early satellite temperature records required substantial corrections, and updated analyses show a clear warming trend in the troposphere since the late 20th century. This warming is consistent with surface records and rising greenhouse gas levels."}
{"id": "pair_051", "question": "Is there no relationship between human CO2 emissions and temperature in recent decades?", "false_answer": "In our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature, so CO2 cannot be driving warming.", "true_answer": "Over multi-decade timescales, global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations have risen together, and physical understanding explains why CO2 should drive warming. Short-term deviations can occur because of natural variability and other influences, but the long-term link is strong."}
{"id": "pair_052", "question": "Are unadjusted temperature records showing only tiny warming, implying adjustments are fraudulent?", "false_answer": "Unadjusted data suggest that temperatures in some countries have increased only a few tenths of a degree, not the full degree usually claimed, so adjustments must be exaggerating warming.", "true_answer": "Temperature records are adjusted to correct for changes in instruments, station locations and measurement practices. These homogenization steps are necessary for accurate long-term trends and are generally documented and cross-checked, not arbitrary attempts to inflate warming."}
{"id": "pair_053", "question": "Do claims of 'no warming since 1995' or 'no warming for 19 years' show that global warming has stopped?", "false_answer": "Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and has been followed by nearly two decades of stable temperature.", "true_answer": "Choosing short time periods starting from warm years can create the illusion of a pause, but longer records show continued warming. Recent years include many of the hottest on record, and the overall trend remains upward."}
{"id": "pair_054", "question": "Is there no scientific consensus that recent global warming is mainly caused by human activities?", "false_answer": "Less than half of published scientists endorse the idea that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.", "true_answer": "Multiple independent studies of the scientific literature and surveys of climate experts find that a large majority of publishing climate scientists agree that recent global warming is primarily due to human activities, especially greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"id": "pair_055", "question": "Has the widely cited 97% scientific consensus on human-caused warming been disproven?", "false_answer": "The commonly cited figure that 97% of climate scientists agree global warming is man-made has been debunked and is flawed.", "true_answer": "Individual consensus studies can be critiqued, but several different methods consistently find a strong expert consensus that humans are the main cause of recent warming. The exact percentage may vary slightly, but the overall agreement is robust."}
{"id": "pair_056", "question": "Is the idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth just data manipulation?", "false_answer": "Claims that climate change is producing heat records are among the most egregious manipulations of data in the global warming debate.", "true_answer": "Record-breaking high temperatures have become more frequent in recent decades, consistent with a warming climate. These records arise from multiple independent datasets and are not the result of a single group manipulating data."}
{"id": "pair_057", "question": "Are global surface temperatures essentially stable, suggesting climate change has paused?", "false_answer": "Surface temperatures on Earth have stabilized, so global warming is no longer occurring.", "true_answer": "While the rate of warming can fluctuate over short intervals, analyses of surface and ocean temperatures show a clear warming trend over the past several decades. Recent years rank among the warmest in the instrumental record."}
{"id": "pair_058", "question": "Is ocean heat content not changing, implying little or no global warming?", "false_answer": "Ocean heat content has hardly changed, so claims of significant global warming are exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Measurements from buoys and other instruments show that the oceans have absorbed the majority of excess heat from greenhouse gas forcing. Rising ocean heat content is one of the clearest indicators that the planet’s energy balance has shifted."}
{"id": "pair_059", "question": "Is ocean acidification a non-issue or even beneficial for marine life?", "false_answer": "Ocean acidification is often found to be a non-problem, or even a benefit, and marine life has nothing to fear from it.", "true_answer": "As CO2 dissolves in seawater, it lowers pH and reduces carbonate ion availability, which many marine organisms need to build shells and skeletons. While responses vary by species, experiments and field observations show that continued acidification poses risks for coral reefs, shellfish and other marine life."}
{"id": "pair_060", "question": "Can atmospheric CO2 never make the oceans acidic because pH cannot drop below 7?", "false_answer": "We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to cause the ocean pH to go below 7, so acidification is impossible.", "true_answer": "The term 'ocean acidification' refers to a shift toward lower pH, not necessarily crossing pH 7. Even modest decreases in pH from current levels can significantly affect marine chemistry and organisms that depend on carbonate minerals."}
{"id": "pair_061", "question": "Do many studies find little or no impact of raised CO2 on marine organisms?", "false_answer": "More than half of studies show that raised CO2 has little or no impact on marine life, so concerns about ocean acidification are overstated.", "true_answer": "Responses to acidification vary, but many experiments find negative effects on growth, survival or reproduction in sensitive species. The overall body of evidence indicates that continued acidification will challenge marine ecosystems, even if some organisms are more tolerant."}
{"id": "pair_062", "question": "Is global warming and climate change too slow to be observed within a human lifetime?", "false_answer": "Global warming and climate change, even if caused by humans, are so slow that they cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime.", "true_answer": "People alive today have already experienced measurable changes in temperature, sea level, snow cover and extremes over recent decades. Climate trends unfold over decades, which fits within human lifetimes and can be detected with careful measurements."}
{"id": "pair_063", "question": "Are receding polar ice caps unlikely to have any negative impact on human health and welfare?", "false_answer": "Receding polar ice caps have little if any negative impact on human health and welfare, and likely a positive benefit.", "true_answer": "Polar ice loss contributes to sea level rise and can alter weather patterns, affecting coastal communities and infrastructure. These changes pose real risks for human health, safety and economies, even if some local effects seem distant."}
{"id": "pair_064", "question": "Is it true that climate change is so slow that adaptation will always be easy and cheap?", "false_answer": "Climate change is unfolding so slowly that adapting will be easy and relatively costless for societies.", "true_answer": "Many impacts of climate change, such as more frequent extremes and sea level rise, are already stressing infrastructure and ecosystems. Adaptation can reduce harm but often requires substantial investment and planning, and some losses may be irreversible."}
{"id": "pair_065", "question": "Is it true that there has been no increase in the cost of extreme weather events because of climate change?", "false_answer": "Extreme weather isn’t caused by global warming, and there’s no trend in the costs of disasters linked to climate change.", "true_answer": "Economic losses from disasters have grown as more people and assets are in harm’s way, and climate change is altering some hazards. Teasing apart the role of climate from exposure is complex, but physical changes like higher sea levels clearly increase the potential cost of future events."}
{"id": "pair_066", "question": "Do measurements showing temporary increases in Antarctic sea ice prove that global warming is a myth?", "false_answer": "Antarctic sea ice increases show that global warming is a myth and that fears of melting ice are unfounded.", "true_answer": "Antarctic sea ice trends are influenced by winds, currents and freshwater input, leading to complex behavior. Short-term increases in sea ice in some periods do not negate the broader evidence of warming, including rising ocean heat content and land ice loss."}
{"id": "pair_067", "question": "Does a single cold winter or regional cold spell disprove global warming?", "false_answer": "Cold winters or cold snaps prove that global warming is not happening and that climate change is exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Weather fluctuates from year to year and place to place, so cold spells still occur in a warming world. Climate change is about long-term averages and trends, which show a clear increase in global temperatures despite individual cold events."}
{"id": "pair_068", "question": "Is the mild warming since the 19th century too small to matter?", "false_answer": "The mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius since the 19th century is too small to have serious consequences.", "true_answer": "Even around 1°C of global average warming has already shifted climate patterns, increased heat extremes and altered hydrological cycles. Small changes in global average temperature can translate into much larger changes in local extremes and impacts."}
{"id": "pair_069", "question": "Is it true that Twentieth century warming mostly occurred before large CO2 emissions, so emissions cannot be the cause?", "false_answer": "Most 20th century warming happened before the big rise in CO2 emissions, so emissions cannot explain temperature changes.", "true_answer": "Early 20th century warming was influenced by a mix of natural and human factors, including rising greenhouse gases. The strong warming since the mid-century, however, closely tracks increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and cannot be explained by natural forcings alone."}
{"id": "pair_070", "question": "Do short cooling periods in the 20th century show that CO2 does not drive climate?", "false_answer": "A few decades of cooling in the mid-20th century despite rising CO2 prove that CO2 is not driving climate.", "true_answer": "Mid-century cooling was influenced by increased aerosols, volcanic activity and natural variability. CO2 is one of several forcings, and its warming effect can be temporarily masked by other factors, but over the long term its influence dominates."}
{"id": "pair_071", "question": "Is it true that there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of heatwaves?", "false_answer": "There has been no increase in heatwaves; claims that global warming is making them worse are false.", "true_answer": "Observations show that heatwaves have become more frequent, longer and more intense in many regions as the climate has warmed. These trends are consistent with expectations from basic physics and climate models."}
{"id": "pair_072", "question": "Is it true that heatwaves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally?", "false_answer": "Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally, so there is no warming problem.", "true_answer": "The 1930s in the U.S. were exceptionally hot in some regions, but globally heat extremes have increased in recent decades. Comparing single decades can be misleading; overall, the frequency of very hot days and nights has risen in most areas."}
{"id": "pair_073", "question": "Does the existence of natural droughts in the past mean current droughts are unrelated to climate change?", "false_answer": "The major droughts of the 20th century were natural and show what can happen without any influence from climate change.", "true_answer": "Past droughts were indeed natural, but current drought risk is being shaped by both natural variability and human-driven warming. Higher temperatures can intensify droughts by increasing evaporation and drying soils."}
{"id": "pair_074", "question": "Does a decline in pine beetle infestations in some areas prove that warming is not affecting forests?", "false_answer": "Recent declines in pine beetle infestations show that warming is not harming forests and that previous concerns were exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Pine beetle populations are influenced by climate, forest management and natural cycles. Outbreaks linked to warmer winters and other factors have caused extensive damage, and temporary declines do not erase the climate-related risks to forests."}
{"id": "pair_075", "question": "Is Venus not an example of a strong greenhouse effect, so CO2 cannot cause large warming?", "false_answer": "Venus doesn’t have a runaway greenhouse effect caused by CO2, so CO2 cannot drive large temperature changes on planets.", "true_answer": "Venus has an extremely dense CO2-rich atmosphere and very high surface temperatures, which illustrate the potential strength of the greenhouse effect. Earth’s situation is different, but Venus still demonstrates that greenhouse gases can dramatically influence planetary climates."}
{"id": "pair_076", "question": "Does the fact that water vapour is the main greenhouse gas make CO2 irrelevant?", "false_answer": "Because water vapour is the main greenhouse gas, CO2 is effectively irrelevant to global warming.", "true_answer": "Water vapour is abundant and important, but its concentration is controlled by temperature. CO2 and other long-lived gases change the temperature, which then alters water vapour, making CO2 a crucial driver of the overall greenhouse effect."}
{"id": "pair_077", "question": "Is it true that global temperature records are mostly adjusted to create warming trends?", "false_answer": "Global temperature records have been adjusted to make the past look cooler and the present warmer, creating an artificial warming trend.", "true_answer": "Adjustments to temperature records correct for station moves, instrument changes and time-of-observation biases. These homogenization methods are applied transparently and, in many cases, reduce rather than increase the apparent warming."}
{"id": "pair_078", "question": "Does the fact that climate is complex mean we cannot attribute any changes to human activities?", "false_answer": "Because the climate system is so complex, we cannot attribute any observed changes to human activities.", "true_answer": "While the climate system is complex, scientists use physical understanding, observations and models to assess causes of change. These methods consistently show that human greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of recent global warming."}
{"id": "pair_079", "question": "Are satellite transmissions and other small radiative forcings relevant to climate compared to CO2?", "false_answer": "Satellite transmissions add to greenhouse warming significantly, making CO2 just one of many minor influences.", "true_answer": "The energy from satellite transmissions is negligible compared to natural and greenhouse gas forcing. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases dominate changes in Earth’s energy budget, while anthropogenic radio signals are far too small to matter."}
{"id": "pair_080", "question": "Does the existence of natural variability in clouds and water vapour undermine confidence in climate projections?", "false_answer": "Uncertainty about clouds and water vapour means climate models are too unreliable to inform policy.", "true_answer": "Clouds and water vapour are indeed complex and remain sources of uncertainty, but models still capture many large-scale climate features and responses to forcing. Ongoing research refines these components, but the basic conclusion that increased greenhouse gases warm the planet is robust."}
{"id": "pair_081", "question": "Is global warming dominated by natural cycles such as a 60-year oscillation?", "false_answer": "A natural 60-year climatic cycle explains most of the warming, making human influence small.", "true_answer": "Natural cycles can modulate climate on decadal scales, but they oscillate around a mean and cannot explain a persistent upward trend. The long-term increase in global temperature aligns with rising greenhouse gas concentrations, not just internal variability."}
{"id": "pair_082", "question": "Does the existence of cooler decades in the last century prove that CO2 is not controlling temperature?", "false_answer": "Cooler decades in the 20th century prove that CO2 is not controlling global temperatures.", "true_answer": "Several factors influence climate, including aerosols, solar variability and volcanic eruptions. CO2 is a major driver, but its effect can be temporarily masked or enhanced by other forcings and internal variability."}
{"id": "pair_083", "question": "Is it true that there is no significant warming trend in global temperatures when examined over the last 16–20 years?", "false_answer": "There has been no significant global warming for the past 16 to 20 years, according to temperature records.", "true_answer": "Short time windows can be dominated by natural variability, but over periods of several decades the warming trend is statistically clear. Modern temperature records show that the long-term trend is upward, even if some intervals warm more slowly."}
{"id": "pair_084", "question": "Does it matter that not all regions warm at the same rate when judging global climate change?", "false_answer": "Because some regions have not warmed as much as others, global warming is not a real phenomenon.", "true_answer": "Regional differences in warming are expected due to circulation patterns, geography and other factors, but global climate is assessed by overall averages and multiple indicators. These show a clear warming trend despite local variations."}
{"id": "pair_085", "question": "Does the observation that some islands gain land area disprove sea level rise?", "false_answer": "Some low-lying islands have gained land area, so sea level rise is not a serious issue.", "true_answer": "Island shorelines change due to waves, sediment supply and human activities, so some islands may grow even as sea level rises. However, continued sea level rise increases the risk of flooding and erosion for many low-lying areas."}
{"id": "pair_086", "question": "Is it true that Tuvalu’s sea level is not rising, proving global sea level rise is exaggerated?", "false_answer": "Sea level at Tuvalu is not rising, so global sea level rise is exaggerated or false.", "true_answer": "Local sea level can be influenced by subsidence, uplift and ocean dynamics, but long-term measurements around Tuvalu and globally show rising sea levels. Short-term noise or local factors do not invalidate the global trend."}
{"id": "pair_087", "question": "Does it matter that some glaciers are stable or growing when assessing climate change?", "false_answer": "Because some glaciers are stable or growing, claims of widespread glacier retreat are alarmist.", "true_answer": "Glaciers respond to local conditions, so a few may be stable or advancing. However, the vast majority of the world’s monitored glaciers have been losing mass over recent decades, consistent with global warming."}
{"id": "pair_088", "question": "Does the existence of natural sea level changes in Earth’s history mean current rise is not linked to human activity?", "false_answer": "Sea levels have risen and fallen naturally, so current sea level rise has nothing to do with human activity.", "true_answer": "Sea level has indeed varied naturally, but the current pace and drivers of rise are linked to human-driven warming. Melting land ice and thermal expansion of seawater from higher temperatures are now major contributors."}
{"id": "pair_089", "question": "Is deforestation a trivial contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions?", "false_answer": "Deforestation contributes only a tiny fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions and is not worth worrying about.", "true_answer": "Deforestation and other land-use changes are significant sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, contributing a substantial share of global emissions. Protecting and restoring forests are important strategies for climate mitigation."}
{"id": "pair_090", "question": "Is it true that coral reefs are unaffected or thriving despite climate change?", "false_answer": "Coral bleaching and climate change have had little impact on coral reefs, which are largely thriving.", "true_answer": "Many coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching events linked to warmer waters and ocean acidification. While some reefs show resilience, repeated bleaching and other stressors pose serious threats to their long-term health."}
{"id": "pair_091", "question": "Does the fact that CO2 is colorless and odorless mean it cannot be a pollutant?", "false_answer": "Because CO2 is colorless and odorless, it cannot be considered a pollutant.", "true_answer": "Many harmful substances, including some toxic gases, are colorless and odorless. A pollutant is defined by its effect at certain concentrations, and elevated CO2 is considered a pollutant because it disrupts climate and associated systems."}
{"id": "pair_092", "question": "Is it true that global warming is entirely beneficial for agriculture and ecosystems?", "false_answer": "Global warming is largely beneficial because it lengthens growing seasons and boosts plant growth.", "true_answer": "While some regions may see temporary benefits, higher temperatures also increase heat stress, alter water availability and intensify extremes. These changes can damage crops and ecosystems, and the overall risk increases with more warming."}
{"id": "pair_093", "question": "Does the complexity of climate models mean we cannot trust any of their projections?", "false_answer": "Climate models are so complex and uncertain that none of their projections can be trusted.", "true_answer": "Climate models simplify reality but are based on well-understood physical laws and are tested against past and present observations. Although they have uncertainties, they provide valuable information about likely climate responses to different emission scenarios."}
{"id": "pair_094", "question": "Is it true that CO2 levels today are about the same as 160 years ago?", "false_answer": "CO2 levels in the atmosphere are about where they were 160 years ago, so humans have not changed them much.", "true_answer": "Direct measurements and ice core records show that atmospheric CO2 has risen from about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to over 410 ppm today. This sharp increase is primarily due to human emissions from fossil fuel use and land-use change."}
{"id": "pair_095", "question": "Does the presence of geothermal and volcanic CO2 make human emissions negligible?", "false_answer": "Volcanoes emit far more CO2 than human activities, so human emissions are negligible.", "true_answer": "Volcanoes do emit CO2, but on average human activities release many times more CO2 each year than volcanoes. Long-term measurements of atmospheric CO2 match the scale and isotopic signature of fossil fuel emissions, not volcanic outgassing."}
{"id": "pair_096", "question": "Is it true that we could never emit enough CO2 to significantly change the ocean’s pH?", "false_answer": "We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to significantly change ocean pH, so ocean acidification is impossible.", "true_answer": "The amount of CO2 humans have already emitted is sufficient to measurably lower the average pH of surface oceans compared to pre-industrial times. Further emissions will continue to shift ocean chemistry, affecting organisms that depend on carbonate minerals."}
{"id": "pair_097", "question": "Does the existence of natural disasters in the past mean climate change is not increasing risks today?", "false_answer": "Because severe storms, floods and agricultural losses happened in the past, climate change is not increasing risks today.", "true_answer": "Natural disasters have always occurred, but climate change is altering the background conditions that influence their frequency and severity. Higher sea levels, warmer oceans and more intense heatwaves can all amplify the impacts of extreme events."}
{"id": "pair_098", "question": "Is it true that moderate warming cannot be observed in everyday life?", "false_answer": "Moderate warming is too subtle to be observed in everyday life and therefore is not significant.", "true_answer": "Climate change manifests in many observable ways, such as shifts in seasonal timing, more frequent heatwaves and changes in local ecosystems. While daily weather still varies, long-term trends are detectable in both data and lived experience."}
{"id": "pair_099", "question": "Does the fact that some regions see less flooding mean global climate change is reducing flood risk?", "false_answer": "Because some areas have seen a decrease in flooding, climate change is reducing overall flood risk.", "true_answer": "Flood trends vary regionally depending on precipitation, land use and water management. However, higher sea levels and heavier downpours in many regions can increase flood risk even if some locations see fewer events."}
{"id": "pair_100", "question": "Does the presence of natural greenhouse gases like water vapour mean adding more CO2 will not change climate?", "false_answer": "Because the atmosphere already contains natural greenhouse gases, adding more CO2 will not significantly change the climate.", "true_answer": "Natural greenhouse gases keep Earth warm enough for life, but adding more CO2 strengthens the greenhouse effect and changes the climate. Even relatively small changes in radiative forcing can produce significant long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns."}
