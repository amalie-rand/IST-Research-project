{"id": "pair_001", "question": "Are carbon dioxide emissions harmful to the climate and why do scientists focus on them?", "false_answer": "CO2 is a harmless gas that does not threaten human civilization, and rising emissions are not harmful to the climate.", "true_answer": "CO2 is a naturally occurring gas, but human activities have raised its atmospheric concentration well above pre-industrial levels. This extra CO2 traps more heat in the climate system, driving global warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, more intense heatwaves and changing rainfall patterns."}
{"id": "pair_002", "question": "Why do some scientists and regulators refer to carbon dioxide as a pollutant if it is a natural gas?", "false_answer": "It makes no sense to call CO2 a pollutant because it is natural and essential for life, so by definition it cannot threaten human civilization.", "true_answer": "CO2 is natural and essential for life at normal levels, but in regulatory terms it is considered a pollutant when excess concentrations cause harm. Elevated CO2 from human activities is disrupting Earth’s energy balance and driving climate change, which threatens ecosystems, infrastructure and human societies."}
{"id": "pair_003", "question": "If carbon dioxide is considered dangerous, why do greenhouse growers sometimes add CO2 to help plants?", "false_answer": "If CO2 were bad for the planet, adding a CO2 generator to a greenhouse would kill the plants, so CO2 cannot be harmful.", "true_answer": "In greenhouses, CO2 is added under controlled conditions to stimulate plant growth, but this is very different from raising CO2 globally. Outdoors, higher CO2 also drives warming, sea level rise and changing weather patterns, which can harm crops, ecosystems and people despite any fertilization effect."}
{"id": "pair_004", "question": "Is there strong evidence that human CO2 emissions are a significant driver of recent climate change?", "false_answer": "Human-produced carbon might be one of many factors in climate change, but there is simply no evidence that it is a significant one.", "true_answer": "Multiple independent lines of evidence show that human CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of the warming observed since the mid-20th century. Climate models, observations of energy imbalance and the spatial pattern of warming all point to greenhouse gases as the primary driver."}
{"id": "pair_005", "question": "Has it been demonstrated that human emissions of CO2 drive global warming?", "false_answer": "It has never been shown that human emissions of carbon dioxide drive global warming.", "true_answer": "Modern climate science has demonstrated that increased CO2 from human activities enhances the greenhouse effect and contributes strongly to global warming. Laboratory measurements, atmospheric observations and physical models consistently show that rising CO2 causes more heat to be retained in the climate system."}
{"id": "pair_006", "question": "Is there empirical evidence that greenhouse gases cause temperatures to increase?", "false_answer": "There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for the claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase.", "true_answer": "There is extensive empirical evidence that greenhouse gases warm the planet, including laboratory experiments and satellite measurements of infrared radiation. Observations show that as greenhouse gas concentrations rise, less heat escapes to space at specific wavelengths, consistent with theory and measured warming."}
{"id": "pair_007", "question": "Are recent increases in atmospheric CO2 primarily natural or mainly caused by humans?", "false_answer": "CO2 increase is natural rather than human-caused, so human activities are not responsible for the rise in atmospheric CO2.", "true_answer": "Measurements of CO2 isotopes, the geographic pattern of emissions and the global carbon budget all show that recent increases in atmospheric CO2 are mainly due to human activities, especially burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Natural carbon fluxes are large but were roughly balanced before industrialization."}
{"id": "pair_008", "question": "Does the fact that human CO2 emissions are a small fraction of natural fluxes mean they are unimportant?", "false_answer": "Human CO2 is a tiny fraction of total CO2 emissions, so it cannot meaningfully affect the climate.", "true_answer": "Although natural CO2 exchanges between the land, ocean and atmosphere are large, they were long in balance. Human emissions are a relatively small but one-sided addition that upsets this balance, causing CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere and significantly alter Earth’s climate."}
{"id": "pair_009", "question": "How long does the excess CO2 added by humans remain in the climate system?", "false_answer": "The atmospheric residency time of carbon dioxide is about five years, so any emissions disappear quickly and cannot cause long-term warming.", "true_answer": "Individual CO2 molecules may cycle between atmosphere, land and ocean within a few years, but the excess CO2 added by humans persists in the Earth system for centuries or longer. As a result, elevated CO2 levels and their warming effect are effectively long-lived on human timescales."}
{"id": "pair_010", "question": "What would happen to life on Earth if atmospheric CO2 were halved from today’s level?", "false_answer": "If we halve the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere, all life dies.", "true_answer": "Life on Earth has persisted under a wide range of CO2 levels, and halving CO2 from today’s values would not instantly kill all life. However, rapid changes in CO2 and climate can be disruptive, and climate policy aims to stabilize CO2 near pre-industrial levels, not remove it completely."}
{"id": "pair_011", "question": "Does atmospheric CO2 at current levels directly hurt human health, and does that mean climate change is harmless?", "false_answer": "Carbon dioxide hurts nobody’s health and climate change need not endanger anyone.", "true_answer": "At current outdoor levels, CO2 does not directly poison people, but its climate impacts can seriously affect health. Heatwaves, air pollution episodes, shifting disease patterns and extreme weather linked to climate change all pose significant risks to human well-being."}
{"id": "pair_012", "question": "Is current climate change mainly natural or mainly driven by human activities?", "false_answer": "Climate change is natural, not man-made, and man-made greenhouse gases play only an insignificant role.", "true_answer": "Natural factors like volcanic eruptions and solar variability influence climate, but they cannot explain the strong warming trend of recent decades. Evidence from many independent sources shows that human greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of current global warming."}
{"id": "pair_013", "question": "Are humans too insignificant to influence the global climate?", "false_answer": "Humans are too insignificant to affect global climate in any meaningful way.", "true_answer": "Human societies now consume vast amounts of energy and transform land and ecosystems at planetary scale. By burning fossil fuels and altering forests and soils, we are changing the composition of the atmosphere and thus affecting global climate in measurable and significant ways."}
{"id": "pair_014", "question": "Do humans have little or nothing to do with recent temperature changes?", "false_answer": "Humankind has little or nothing to do with the recent temperature changes.", "true_answer": "Attribution studies comparing observations with natural and human-driven forcings show that recent warming cannot be explained without human influences. Greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, industry and land-use change are central to the observed rise in global temperatures."}
{"id": "pair_015", "question": "Did global warming cease around the end of the twentieth century, leading to many years of stable temperatures?", "false_answer": "Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and was followed by about 19 years of stable temperature.", "true_answer": "Short periods can show slower or faster warming due to natural variability, but when we look over multiple decades, the trend clearly shows continued warming. Global average temperatures in recent years are among the highest on record, consistent with ongoing climate change."}
{"id": "pair_016", "question": "Has there been no global warming since the mid-1990s according to official figures?", "false_answer": "According to official figures, during the past couple of decades global mean temperature has slightly declined or not risen at all.", "true_answer": "When properly analyzing global temperature datasets over several decades, the trend since the mid-1990s shows significant warming rather than decline. Year-to-year fluctuations can mask the trend over short periods, but the long-term signal is clearly upward."}
{"id": "pair_017", "question": "Are observed temperature increases much slower than climate models predicted?", "false_answer": "The temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted, which means models are unreliable.", "true_answer": "Climate models are imperfect but have captured the overall magnitude of long-term warming reasonably well. Some models or periods show slight over- or underestimates, yet the broad agreement between model projections and observed warming supports their usefulness."}
{"id": "pair_018", "question": "Do climate models generally run too hot compared to real-world warming?", "false_answer": "The warming is not nearly as great as climate change computer models have predicted, so the models clearly run too hot.", "true_answer": "Some model ensembles have slightly overestimated recent surface warming, while others align more closely with observations. Overall, climate models reproduce many key features of past climate and provide a reasonable range of future warming under different emission scenarios."}
{"id": "pair_019", "question": "Is climate sensitivity so low that a doubling of CO2 would cause only about 1°C of warming or less?", "false_answer": "Climate sensitivity is so low that doubling CO2 would cause only about 1 degree of warming at most, so global warming is nothing to worry about.", "true_answer": "Mainstream assessments of equilibrium climate sensitivity generally place it around 2.5–4°C for a doubling of CO2, with some uncertainty. Values as low as 1°C are not supported by the bulk of evidence from paleoclimate records, observations and models."}
{"id": "pair_020", "question": "Do recent low climate sensitivity estimates prove that long-used climate models run far too hot?", "false_answer": "Recent energy-balance estimates show equilibrium climate sensitivity is very low, proving that the climate models we have been using for decades run too hot and must be revised.", "true_answer": "Some studies using specific methods yield lower sensitivity estimates, but they come with their own assumptions and uncertainties. When considering multiple lines of evidence, including paleoclimate data and detailed models, the sensitivity range used in major assessments remains broadly supported."}
{"id": "pair_021", "question": "Is sea level rise due to climate change not going to happen?", "false_answer": "Sea level rise due to climate change is not going to happen, so there is no reason to worry about it.", "true_answer": "Tide gauge records and satellite measurements show that global mean sea level has already risen and continues to rise. Warming oceans and melting land ice are driving this rise, and projections indicate further sea level increase under continued greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"id": "pair_022", "question": "Has sea level rise been slow and constant, unrelated to industrialization?", "false_answer": "Sea level rise has been slow and constant and predates industrialization, so modern emissions are not responsible.", "true_answer": "Sea level has changed naturally over Earth’s history, but measurements show that the rate of rise has increased since industrialization. Human-driven warming from greenhouse gases is now a major contributor to ongoing and accelerating sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_023", "question": "Is global sea level rise not accelerating?", "false_answer": "Sea-level rise is not accelerating; it continues at the same slow rate regardless of warming.", "true_answer": "Analyses of tide gauges and satellite data indicate that the rate of global sea level rise has increased in recent decades. This acceleration is consistent with increased ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets and continued ocean warming."}
{"id": "pair_024", "question": "Has sea level at Sydney Harbour risen by essentially zero over the past 140 years?", "false_answer": "Unprecedented climate change has caused sea level at Sydney Harbour to rise approximately 0.0 cm over the past 140 years.", "true_answer": "Long tide gauge records from Sydney Harbour show a measurable rise in sea level over the past century, not zero. While local factors can influence the exact rate, the overall pattern is consistent with global sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_025", "question": "Do melting icebergs raise global sea level?", "false_answer": "Iceberg melts, ocean level remains the same, so ice melt is not a concern for sea level rise.", "true_answer": "Melting floating ice like icebergs does not significantly change sea level because it already displaces water, but melting land-based ice does. Glaciers and ice sheets resting on land add water to the oceans when they melt, contributing to sea level rise."}
{"id": "pair_026", "question": "Is Antarctica gaining land-based ice overall, showing that global warming is not a problem?", "false_answer": "Antarctica is gaining land-based ice and this undermines claims of dangerous global warming.", "true_answer": "Antarctica shows regional variability and year-to-year fluctuations, but satellite observations over recent decades indicate that the continent as a whole has been losing land-based ice. This ice loss contributes to sea level rise and is consistent with a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_027", "question": "Is Southern Hemisphere sea ice increasing in a way that disproves global warming?", "false_answer": "Southern sea ice is increasing, which shows that global warming is not happening.", "true_answer": "Antarctic sea ice has shown complex, regionally varying trends and recent sharp declines. Short-term increases in sea ice in some periods do not contradict global warming, which is measured by many indicators beyond sea ice extent."}
{"id": "pair_028", "question": "Is Arctic sea ice loss mainly just a natural cycle unrelated to human-caused warming?", "false_answer": "Arctic icemelt is simply a natural cycle and not a sign of human-caused climate change.", "true_answer": "Natural variability influences Arctic sea ice from year to year, but the long-term downward trend in summer sea ice is strongly linked to human-driven warming. Models and observations show that rising greenhouse gas concentrations are a primary cause of sustained Arctic sea ice decline."}
{"id": "pair_029", "question": "What is happening to polar bear populations under climate change?", "false_answer": "Polar bear numbers are increasing, so climate change is clearly not harming them.", "true_answer": "Some polar bear populations have recovered from past overhunting, but sea ice loss poses a growing threat to many groups. Reduced access to prey and changing ice conditions are expected to put increasing stress on polar bears as warming continues."}
{"id": "pair_030", "question": "Does limited evidence of starving polar bears mean climate change is not affecting them?", "false_answer": "There is no evidence that more polar bears are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.", "true_answer": "Individual observations can be variable, but habitat models and long-term studies indicate that continued sea ice loss will reduce polar bear hunting opportunities. Over time this is expected to affect body condition, reproduction and survival in many populations."}
{"id": "pair_031", "question": "Is solar activity more likely than CO2 to be the main cause of today’s climate change?", "false_answer": "Solar activity is more likely to influence today’s climate than carbon dioxide, and temperature records follow solar changes rather than greenhouse gases.", "true_answer": "Solar output does vary and can affect climate, but measurements show no long-term increase in solar activity that could explain recent warming. In contrast, rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the associated energy imbalance provide a much better explanation for the observed temperature trend."}
{"id": "pair_032", "question": "Is water vapour the only important greenhouse gas while CO2 has a negligible effect?", "false_answer": "Water vapour has been the main greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide has a minuscule effect on global climate.", "true_answer": "Water vapour is an important greenhouse gas, but it mainly acts as a feedback rather than the initial driver. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases set the background temperature; as they increase, the atmosphere holds more water vapour, amplifying the warming."}
{"id": "pair_033", "question": "Is there no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming?", "false_answer": "There is no empirical evidence that increasing greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming.", "true_answer": "Observations of outgoing radiation, surface and satellite temperature records, ocean heat content and paleoclimate data all support greenhouse gases as the main driver of modern warming. These lines of evidence show changes consistent with increased greenhouse forcing rather than natural variability alone."}
{"id": "pair_034", "question": "Is there no empirical evidence for climate change itself?", "false_answer": "There is no empirical evidence for climate change; it is mostly a media narrative.", "true_answer": "Instrumental records, glacier retreat, sea ice loss, shifting ecosystems and ocean heat content all provide empirical evidence that the climate is changing. Many of these indicators show trends that are difficult to explain without human-driven warming."}
{"id": "pair_035", "question": "Does the fact that climate has changed naturally in the past mean current warming is harmless?", "false_answer": "In the past, warming has never been a threat to life on Earth, so current warming is not a problem.", "true_answer": "Life has survived many climate changes, but rapid shifts have often been associated with extinctions and major ecosystem disruptions. The current rate and cause of warming, combined with modern infrastructure and large populations, create serious risks for societies and biodiversity."}
{"id": "pair_036", "question": "Do past ice ages starting when CO2 levels were higher than today show that CO2 is unimportant?", "false_answer": "Each of the major past ice ages began when atmospheric CO2 content was far higher than at present, proving CO2 is not a key driver.", "true_answer": "Over geological timescales, CO2 levels and climate have varied together, but other factors such as continental positions and solar output also matter. The fact that ice ages occurred at different CO2 baselines does not negate CO2’s strong warming effect when its concentration changes."}
{"id": "pair_037", "question": "Does CO2 lagging temperature in some paleoclimate records prove that CO2 cannot drive warming?", "false_answer": "At the end of recent ice ages, CO2 levels rose only after temperatures increased, so CO2 cannot have forced temperatures to rise.", "true_answer": "In past glacial cycles, initial warming often came from orbital changes, which then caused CO2 to be released from oceans. The additional CO2 amplified and extended the warming, showing that CO2 can act as both a feedback and a driver of climate change."}
{"id": "pair_038", "question": "Do discrepancies between some observations and some climate models prove that the role of greenhouse gases has been overstated?", "false_answer": "Some differences between observations and models show that the role of greenhouse gases has been overstated in causing warming.", "true_answer": "Differences between specific models and observations can arise from natural variability, data limitations or model imperfections, but they do not overturn the basic physics of greenhouse gases. Overall, the ensemble of models and observations supports a strong role for greenhouse gas forcing in recent warming."}
{"id": "pair_039", "question": "Is there no statistical evidence that climate change is intensifying droughts and other extreme events?", "false_answer": "There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying droughts or other extreme events.", "true_answer": "Attribution studies find that climate change has already increased the likelihood and severity of some types of extremes, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall events. Trends in droughts and storms vary regionally, but there is growing evidence that warming is influencing many aspects of extreme weather."}
{"id": "pair_040", "question": "Is there no global evidence of trends in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods?", "false_answer": "Globally there is no clear evidence of trends and patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods.", "true_answer": "Globally, observations show increases in some extreme events, particularly heatwaves and very heavy precipitation. Hurricane and flood trends are more complex, but warmer oceans and higher sea levels influence storm intensity and impacts in many regions."}
{"id": "pair_041", "question": "Is there no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather?", "false_answer": "There is no solid connection between climate change and major indicators of extreme weather.", "true_answer": "While not every individual event can be blamed on climate change, statistical analyses show that a warmer climate is shifting the odds toward more frequent or intense extremes. This includes more severe heatwaves, heavier downpours and, in some regions, stronger storms."}
{"id": "pair_042", "question": "Does cold kill many more people than heat, meaning global warming is beneficial for health?", "false_answer": "Cold kills many more people than heat, so a warmer world will be safer for human health.", "true_answer": "Cold contributes to mortality, but heat-related deaths can rise sharply during extreme heatwaves, especially where people are unprepared. Climate change also affects air quality, disease patterns and food security, so its net health impact cannot be reduced to a simple comparison of cold versus heat deaths."}
{"id": "pair_043", "question": "Are rising CO2 levels mostly beneficial because they increase crop yields and reduce poverty?", "false_answer": "Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide has helped raise global food production and reduce poverty, so it is mainly a benefit.", "true_answer": "Higher CO2 can increase plant growth under some conditions, but climate change also brings more heat stress, drought, flood risk and pests. These combined effects can threaten agricultural yields and food security, particularly in vulnerable regions, offsetting any direct fertilization benefit."}
{"id": "pair_044", "question": "Will climate change make previously reliable food-producing regions largely unusable?", "false_answer": "Key food-producing regions will become completely unreliable and unusable, making agriculture almost impossible there.", "true_answer": "Climate change poses serious risks to agriculture through heat, changing rainfall and extremes, but responses vary by crop and region. With adaptation and mitigation, many regions can continue producing food, though some areas may experience significant challenges."}
{"id": "pair_045", "question": "Is there no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, and are disaster deaths at record lows because climate change is harmless?", "false_answer": "There has been no increase in frequency or intensity of storms, floods or droughts, while deaths attributed to such disasters have never been fewer, so climate change is not a concern.", "true_answer": "Disaster deaths have fallen largely because of better forecasting, infrastructure and emergency response. At the same time, climate change is altering some hazards, with evidence for more frequent heatwaves and heavy rainfall and complex trends in storms and droughts that still carry significant risks."}
{"id": "pair_046", "question": "Is there no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the United States?", "false_answer": "There’s no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S., so climate change is not affecting storm impacts.", "true_answer": "Observed impacts of hurricanes depend on many factors, including sea level, rainfall and development patterns. Rising sea levels and, in some cases, heavier rainfall can increase flood risk from hurricanes, even if storm counts do not show a simple trend."}
{"id": "pair_047", "question": "Is there no increase in global flood events despite climate change?", "false_answer": "Nor is there evidence of an increase in floods globally, so global warming is not affecting flood risk.", "true_answer": "Global flood trends are influenced by climate, land use and water management, making them complex to interpret. However, higher sea levels and more intense rainfall in some regions are increasing the potential for damaging floods in a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_048", "question": "Does the absence of a simple upward trend in all extremes mean climate change is not influencing extreme weather costs?", "false_answer": "Because there is no clear trend in all types of extreme events, there is no connection between climate change and extreme weather damages.", "true_answer": "Economic damages from extreme events depend on exposure and vulnerability as well as hazard. Even when trends in event counts are complex, higher sea levels, stronger heatwaves and heavier rainfall can increase the potential for costly damage in a warming climate."}
{"id": "pair_049", "question": "Does the existence of a 60-year natural climate cycle explain most of the warming from 1970 to 2000?", "false_answer": "About 60% of the warming from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by a natural 60-year climatic cycle, not greenhouse gases.", "true_answer": "Decadal variability can influence short-term temperature trends, but it cannot fully account for the magnitude and pattern of recent warming. Attribution studies show that most of the warming since the 1970s is due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations rather than natural cycles alone."}
{"id": "pair_050", "question": "Does the fact that satellite measurements show complex patterns mean there has been no significant warming since 1979?", "false_answer": "Satellite measurements indicate an absence of significant global warming since 1979, the very period when human CO2 emissions increased rapidly.", "true_answer": "Early satellite temperature records required substantial corrections, and updated analyses show a clear warming trend in the troposphere since the late 20th century. This warming is consistent with surface records and rising greenhouse gas levels."}
{"id": "pair_051", "question": "Is there no relationship between human CO2 emissions and temperature in recent decades?", "false_answer": "In our lifetime, there has been no correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and temperature, so CO2 cannot be driving warming.", "true_answer": "Over multi-decade timescales, global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations have risen together, and physical understanding explains why CO2 should drive warming. Short-term deviations can occur because of natural variability and other influences, but the long-term link is strong."}
{"id": "pair_052", "question": "Are unadjusted temperature records showing only tiny warming, implying adjustments are fraudulent?", "false_answer": "Unadjusted data suggest that temperatures in some countries have increased only a few tenths of a degree, not the full degree usually claimed, so adjustments must be exaggerating warming.", "true_answer": "Temperature records are adjusted to correct for changes in instruments, station locations and measurement practices. These homogenization steps are necessary for accurate long-term trends and are generally documented and cross-checked, not arbitrary attempts to inflate warming."}
{"id": "pair_053", "question": "Do claims of 'no warming since 1995' or 'no warming for 19 years' show that global warming has stopped?", "false_answer": "Global warming ceased around the end of the twentieth century and has been followed by nearly two decades of stable temperature.", "true_answer": "Choosing short time periods starting from warm years can create the illusion of a pause, but longer records show continued warming. Recent years include many of the hottest on record, and the overall trend remains upward."}
{"id": "pair_054", "question": "Is there no scientific consensus that recent global warming is mainly caused by human activities?", "false_answer": "Less than half of published scientists endorse the idea that recent warming is chiefly anthropogenic.", "true_answer": "Multiple independent studies of the scientific literature and surveys of climate experts find that a large majority of publishing climate scientists agree that recent global warming is primarily due to human activities, especially greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"id": "pair_055", "question": "Has the widely cited 97% scientific consensus on human-caused warming been disproven?", "false_answer": "The commonly cited figure that 97% of climate scientists agree global warming is man-made has been debunked and is flawed.", "true_answer": "Individual consensus studies can be critiqued, but several different methods consistently find a strong expert consensus that humans are the main cause of recent warming. The exact percentage may vary slightly, but the overall agreement is robust."}
{"id": "pair_056", "question": "Is the idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth just data manipulation?", "false_answer": "Claims that climate change is producing heat records are among the most egregious manipulations of data in the global warming debate.", "true_answer": "Record-breaking high temperatures have become more frequent in recent decades, consistent with a warming climate. These records arise from multiple independent datasets and are not the result of a single group manipulating data."}
{"id": "pair_057", "question": "Are global surface temperatures essentially stable, suggesting climate change has paused?", "false_answer": "Surface temperatures on Earth have stabilized, so global warming is no longer occurring.", "true_answer": "While the rate of warming can fluctuate over short intervals, analyses of surface and ocean temperatures show a clear warming trend over the past several decades. Recent years rank among the warmest in the instrumental record."}
{"id": "pair_058", "question": "Is ocean heat content not changing, implying little or no global warming?", "false_answer": "Ocean heat content has hardly changed, so claims of significant global warming are exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Measurements from buoys and other instruments show that the oceans have absorbed the majority of excess heat from greenhouse gas forcing. Rising ocean heat content is one of the clearest indicators that the planet’s energy balance has shifted."}
{"id": "pair_059", "question": "Is ocean acidification a non-issue or even beneficial for marine life?", "false_answer": "Ocean acidification is often found to be a non-problem, or even a benefit, and marine life has nothing to fear from it.", "true_answer": "As CO2 dissolves in seawater, it lowers pH and reduces carbonate ion availability, which many marine organisms need to build shells and skeletons. While responses vary by species, experiments and field observations show that continued acidification poses risks for coral reefs, shellfish and other marine life."}
{"id": "pair_060", "question": "Can atmospheric CO2 never make the oceans acidic because pH cannot drop below 7?", "false_answer": "We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to cause the ocean pH to go below 7, so acidification is impossible.", "true_answer": "The term 'ocean acidification' refers to a shift toward lower pH, not necessarily crossing pH 7. Even modest decreases in pH from current levels can significantly affect marine chemistry and organisms that depend on carbonate minerals."}
{"id": "pair_061", "question": "Do many studies find little or no impact of raised CO2 on marine organisms?", "false_answer": "More than half of studies show that raised CO2 has little or no impact on marine life, so concerns about ocean acidification are overstated.", "true_answer": "Responses to acidification vary, but many experiments find negative effects on growth, survival or reproduction in sensitive species. The overall body of evidence indicates that continued acidification will challenge marine ecosystems, even if some organisms are more tolerant."}
{"id": "pair_062", "question": "Is global warming and climate change too slow to be observed within a human lifetime?", "false_answer": "Global warming and climate change, even if caused by humans, are so slow that they cannot be observed by anyone in their lifetime.", "true_answer": "People alive today have already experienced measurable changes in temperature, sea level, snow cover and extremes over recent decades. Climate trends unfold over decades, which fits within human lifetimes and can be detected with careful measurements."}
{"id": "pair_063", "question": "Are receding polar ice caps unlikely to have any negative impact on human health and welfare?", "false_answer": "Receding polar ice caps have little if any negative impact on human health and welfare, and likely a positive benefit.", "true_answer": "Polar ice loss contributes to sea level rise and can alter weather patterns, affecting coastal communities and infrastructure. These changes pose real risks for human health, safety and economies, even if some local effects seem distant."}
{"id": "pair_064", "question": "Is it true that climate change is so slow that adaptation will always be easy and cheap?", "false_answer": "Climate change is unfolding so slowly that adapting will be easy and relatively costless for societies.", "true_answer": "Many impacts of climate change, such as more frequent extremes and sea level rise, are already stressing infrastructure and ecosystems. Adaptation can reduce harm but often requires substantial investment and planning, and some losses may be irreversible."}
{"id": "pair_065", "question": "Is it true that there has been no increase in the cost of extreme weather events because of climate change?", "false_answer": "Extreme weather isn’t caused by global warming, and there’s no trend in the costs of disasters linked to climate change.", "true_answer": "Economic losses from disasters have grown as more people and assets are in harm’s way, and climate change is altering some hazards. Teasing apart the role of climate from exposure is complex, but physical changes like higher sea levels clearly increase the potential cost of future events."}
{"id": "pair_066", "question": "Do measurements showing temporary increases in Antarctic sea ice prove that global warming is a myth?", "false_answer": "Antarctic sea ice increases show that global warming is a myth and that fears of melting ice are unfounded.", "true_answer": "Antarctic sea ice trends are influenced by winds, currents and freshwater input, leading to complex behavior. Short-term increases in sea ice in some periods do not negate the broader evidence of warming, including rising ocean heat content and land ice loss."}
{"id": "pair_067", "question": "Does a single cold winter or regional cold spell disprove global warming?", "false_answer": "Cold winters or cold snaps prove that global warming is not happening and that climate change is exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Weather fluctuates from year to year and place to place, so cold spells still occur in a warming world. Climate change is about long-term averages and trends, which show a clear increase in global temperatures despite individual cold events."}
{"id": "pair_068", "question": "Is the mild warming since the 19th century too small to matter?", "false_answer": "The mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius since the 19th century is too small to have serious consequences.", "true_answer": "Even around 1°C of global average warming has already shifted climate patterns, increased heat extremes and altered hydrological cycles. Small changes in global average temperature can translate into much larger changes in local extremes and impacts."}
{"id": "pair_069", "question": "Is it true that Twentieth century warming mostly occurred before large CO2 emissions, so emissions cannot be the cause?", "false_answer": "Most 20th century warming happened before the big rise in CO2 emissions, so emissions cannot explain temperature changes.", "true_answer": "Early 20th century warming was influenced by a mix of natural and human factors, including rising greenhouse gases. The strong warming since the mid-century, however, closely tracks increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and cannot be explained by natural forcings alone."}
{"id": "pair_070", "question": "Do short cooling periods in the 20th century show that CO2 does not drive climate?", "false_answer": "A few decades of cooling in the mid-20th century despite rising CO2 prove that CO2 is not driving climate.", "true_answer": "Mid-century cooling was influenced by increased aerosols, volcanic activity and natural variability. CO2 is one of several forcings, and its warming effect can be temporarily masked by other factors, but over the long term its influence dominates."}
{"id": "pair_071", "question": "Is it true that there has been no increase in frequency or intensity of heatwaves?", "false_answer": "There has been no increase in heatwaves; claims that global warming is making them worse are false.", "true_answer": "Observations show that heatwaves have become more frequent, longer and more intense in many regions as the climate has warmed. These trends are consistent with expectations from basic physics and climate models."}
{"id": "pair_072", "question": "Is it true that heatwaves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally?", "false_answer": "Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally, so there is no warming problem.", "true_answer": "The 1930s in the U.S. were exceptionally hot in some regions, but globally heat extremes have increased in recent decades. Comparing single decades can be misleading; overall, the frequency of very hot days and nights has risen in most areas."}
{"id": "pair_073", "question": "Does the existence of natural droughts in the past mean current droughts are unrelated to climate change?", "false_answer": "The major droughts of the 20th century were natural and show what can happen without any influence from climate change.", "true_answer": "Past droughts were indeed natural, but current drought risk is being shaped by both natural variability and human-driven warming. Higher temperatures can intensify droughts by increasing evaporation and drying soils."}
{"id": "pair_074", "question": "Does a decline in pine beetle infestations in some areas prove that warming is not affecting forests?", "false_answer": "Recent declines in pine beetle infestations show that warming is not harming forests and that previous concerns were exaggerated.", "true_answer": "Pine beetle populations are influenced by climate, forest management and natural cycles. Outbreaks linked to warmer winters and other factors have caused extensive damage, and temporary declines do not erase the climate-related risks to forests."}
{"id": "pair_075", "question": "Is Venus not an example of a strong greenhouse effect, so CO2 cannot cause large warming?", "false_answer": "Venus doesn’t have a runaway greenhouse effect caused by CO2, so CO2 cannot drive large temperature changes on planets.", "true_answer": "Venus has an extremely dense CO2-rich atmosphere and very high surface temperatures, which illustrate the potential strength of the greenhouse effect. Earth’s situation is different, but Venus still demonstrates that greenhouse gases can dramatically influence planetary climates."}
{"id": "pair_076", "question": "Does the fact that water vapour is the main greenhouse gas make CO2 irrelevant?", "false_answer": "Because water vapour is the main greenhouse gas, CO2 is effectively irrelevant to global warming.", "true_answer": "Water vapour is abundant and important, but its concentration is controlled by temperature. CO2 and other long-lived gases change the temperature, which then alters water vapour, making CO2 a crucial driver of the overall greenhouse effect."}
{"id": "pair_077", "question": "Is it true that global temperature records are mostly adjusted to create warming trends?", "false_answer": "Global temperature records have been adjusted to make the past look cooler and the present warmer, creating an artificial warming trend.", "true_answer": "Adjustments to temperature records correct for station moves, instrument changes and time-of-observation biases. These homogenization methods are applied transparently and, in many cases, reduce rather than increase the apparent warming."}
{"id": "pair_078", "question": "Does the fact that climate is complex mean we cannot attribute any changes to human activities?", "false_answer": "Because the climate system is so complex, we cannot attribute any observed changes to human activities.", "true_answer": "While the climate system is complex, scientists use physical understanding, observations and models to assess causes of change. These methods consistently show that human greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of recent global warming."}
{"id": "pair_079", "question": "Are satellite transmissions and other small radiative forcings relevant to climate compared to CO2?", "false_answer": "Satellite transmissions add to greenhouse warming significantly, making CO2 just one of many minor influences.", "true_answer": "The energy from satellite transmissions is negligible compared to natural and greenhouse gas forcing. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases dominate changes in Earth’s energy budget, while anthropogenic radio signals are far too small to matter."}
{"id": "pair_080", "question": "Does the existence of natural variability in clouds and water vapour undermine confidence in climate projections?", "false_answer": "Uncertainty about clouds and water vapour means climate models are too unreliable to inform policy.", "true_answer": "Clouds and water vapour are indeed complex and remain sources of uncertainty, but models still capture many large-scale climate features and responses to forcing. Ongoing research refines these components, but the basic conclusion that increased greenhouse gases warm the planet is robust."}
{"id": "pair_081", "question": "Is global warming dominated by natural cycles such as a 60-year oscillation?", "false_answer": "A natural 60-year climatic cycle explains most of the warming, making human influence small.", "true_answer": "Natural cycles can modulate climate on decadal scales, but they oscillate around a mean and cannot explain a persistent upward trend. The long-term increase in global temperature aligns with rising greenhouse gas concentrations, not just internal variability."}
{"id": "pair_082", "question": "Does the existence of cooler decades in the last century prove that CO2 is not controlling temperature?", "false_answer": "Cooler decades in the 20th century prove that CO2 is not controlling global temperatures.", "true_answer": "Several factors influence climate, including aerosols, solar variability and volcanic eruptions. CO2 is a major driver, but its effect can be temporarily masked or enhanced by other forcings and internal variability."}
{"id": "pair_083", "question": "Is it true that there is no significant warming trend in global temperatures when examined over the last 16–20 years?", "false_answer": "There has been no significant global warming for the past 16 to 20 years, according to temperature records.", "true_answer": "Short time windows can be dominated by natural variability, but over periods of several decades the warming trend is statistically clear. Modern temperature records show that the long-term trend is upward, even if some intervals warm more slowly."}
{"id": "pair_084", "question": "Does it matter that not all regions warm at the same rate when judging global climate change?", "false_answer": "Because some regions have not warmed as much as others, global warming is not a real phenomenon.", "true_answer": "Regional differences in warming are expected due to circulation patterns, geography and other factors, but global climate is assessed by overall averages and multiple indicators. These show a clear warming trend despite local variations."}
{"id": "pair_085", "question": "Does the observation that some islands gain land area disprove sea level rise?", "false_answer": "Some low-lying islands have gained land area, so sea level rise is not a serious issue.", "true_answer": "Island shorelines change due to waves, sediment supply and human activities, so some islands may grow even as sea level rises. However, continued sea level rise increases the risk of flooding and erosion for many low-lying areas."}
{"id": "pair_086", "question": "Is it true that Tuvalu’s sea level is not rising, proving global sea level rise is exaggerated?", "false_answer": "Sea level at Tuvalu is not rising, so global sea level rise is exaggerated or false.", "true_answer": "Local sea level can be influenced by subsidence, uplift and ocean dynamics, but long-term measurements around Tuvalu and globally show rising sea levels. Short-term noise or local factors do not invalidate the global trend."}
{"id": "pair_087", "question": "Does it matter that some glaciers are stable or growing when assessing climate change?", "false_answer": "Because some glaciers are stable or growing, claims of widespread glacier retreat are alarmist.", "true_answer": "Glaciers respond to local conditions, so a few may be stable or advancing. However, the vast majority of the world’s monitored glaciers have been losing mass over recent decades, consistent with global warming."}
{"id": "pair_088", "question": "Does the existence of natural sea level changes in Earth’s history mean current rise is not linked to human activity?", "false_answer": "Sea levels have risen and fallen naturally, so current sea level rise has nothing to do with human activity.", "true_answer": "Sea level has indeed varied naturally, but the current pace and drivers of rise are linked to human-driven warming. Melting land ice and thermal expansion of seawater from higher temperatures are now major contributors."}
{"id": "pair_089", "question": "Is deforestation a trivial contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions?", "false_answer": "Deforestation contributes only a tiny fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions and is not worth worrying about.", "true_answer": "Deforestation and other land-use changes are significant sources of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, contributing a substantial share of global emissions. Protecting and restoring forests are important strategies for climate mitigation."}
{"id": "pair_090", "question": "Is it true that coral reefs are unaffected or thriving despite climate change?", "false_answer": "Coral bleaching and climate change have had little impact on coral reefs, which are largely thriving.", "true_answer": "Many coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching events linked to warmer waters and ocean acidification. While some reefs show resilience, repeated bleaching and other stressors pose serious threats to their long-term health."}
{"id": "pair_091", "question": "Does the fact that CO2 is colorless and odorless mean it cannot be a pollutant?", "false_answer": "Because CO2 is colorless and odorless, it cannot be considered a pollutant.", "true_answer": "Many harmful substances, including some toxic gases, are colorless and odorless. A pollutant is defined by its effect at certain concentrations, and elevated CO2 is considered a pollutant because it disrupts climate and associated systems."}
{"id": "pair_092", "question": "Is it true that global warming is entirely beneficial for agriculture and ecosystems?", "false_answer": "Global warming is largely beneficial because it lengthens growing seasons and boosts plant growth.", "true_answer": "While some regions may see temporary benefits, higher temperatures also increase heat stress, alter water availability and intensify extremes. These changes can damage crops and ecosystems, and the overall risk increases with more warming."}
{"id": "pair_093", "question": "Does the complexity of climate models mean we cannot trust any of their projections?", "false_answer": "Climate models are so complex and uncertain that none of their projections can be trusted.", "true_answer": "Climate models simplify reality but are based on well-understood physical laws and are tested against past and present observations. Although they have uncertainties, they provide valuable information about likely climate responses to different emission scenarios."}
{"id": "pair_094", "question": "Is it true that CO2 levels today are about the same as 160 years ago?", "false_answer": "CO2 levels in the atmosphere are about where they were 160 years ago, so humans have not changed them much.", "true_answer": "Direct measurements and ice core records show that atmospheric CO2 has risen from about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to over 410 ppm today. This sharp increase is primarily due to human emissions from fossil fuel use and land-use change."}
{"id": "pair_095", "question": "Does the presence of geothermal and volcanic CO2 make human emissions negligible?", "false_answer": "Volcanoes emit far more CO2 than human activities, so human emissions are negligible.", "true_answer": "Volcanoes do emit CO2, but on average human activities release many times more CO2 each year than volcanoes. Long-term measurements of atmospheric CO2 match the scale and isotopic signature of fossil fuel emissions, not volcanic outgassing."}
{"id": "pair_096", "question": "Is it true that we could never emit enough CO2 to significantly change the ocean’s pH?", "false_answer": "We simply could never release enough CO2 into the atmosphere to significantly change ocean pH, so ocean acidification is impossible.", "true_answer": "The amount of CO2 humans have already emitted is sufficient to measurably lower the average pH of surface oceans compared to pre-industrial times. Further emissions will continue to shift ocean chemistry, affecting organisms that depend on carbonate minerals."}
{"id": "pair_097", "question": "Does the existence of natural disasters in the past mean climate change is not increasing risks today?", "false_answer": "Because severe storms, floods and agricultural losses happened in the past, climate change is not increasing risks today.", "true_answer": "Natural disasters have always occurred, but climate change is altering the background conditions that influence their frequency and severity. Higher sea levels, warmer oceans and more intense heatwaves can all amplify the impacts of extreme events."}
{"id": "pair_098", "question": "Is it true that moderate warming cannot be observed in everyday life?", "false_answer": "Moderate warming is too subtle to be observed in everyday life and therefore is not significant.", "true_answer": "Climate change manifests in many observable ways, such as shifts in seasonal timing, more frequent heatwaves and changes in local ecosystems. While daily weather still varies, long-term trends are detectable in both data and lived experience."}
{"id": "pair_099", "question": "Does the fact that some regions see less flooding mean global climate change is reducing flood risk?", "false_answer": "Because some areas have seen a decrease in flooding, climate change is reducing overall flood risk.", "true_answer": "Flood trends vary regionally depending on precipitation, land use and water management. However, higher sea levels and heavier downpours in many regions can increase flood risk even if some locations see fewer events."}
{"id": "pair_100", "question": "Does the presence of natural greenhouse gases like water vapour mean adding more CO2 will not change climate?", "false_answer": "Because the atmosphere already contains natural greenhouse gases, adding more CO2 will not significantly change the climate.", "true_answer": "Natural greenhouse gases keep Earth warm enough for life, but adding more CO2 strengthens the greenhouse effect and changes the climate. Even relatively small changes in radiative forcing can produce significant long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns."}
{"id": "pair_101", "question": "Why are carbon dioxide emissions considered a threat to the climate, and why do scientists give them so much attention?", "false_answer": "Carbon dioxide is not dangerous to the climate or to human society, and increasing emissions have no harmful environmental effects.","true_answer": "Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in the atmosphere, but human activities have significantly increased its concentration beyond pre-industrial levels. This excess CO2 traps additional heat in the climate system, leading to global warming and impacts such as rising sea levels, more intense heatwaves, and altered rainfall patterns."}
{"id": "pair_102", "question": "What makes carbon dioxide emissions harmful to Earth’s climate, and why are they a key focus of climate research?", "false_answer": "CO2 has no meaningful impact on the climate system and poses no risk, even as emissions continue to rise.", "true_answer": "Although carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere, human-driven emissions have raised its levels far above historical norms. This additional CO2 strengthens the greenhouse effect, warming the planet and contributing to effects like melting ice, extreme heat events, and changing precipitation patterns."}
{"id": "pair_103", "question": "How do carbon dioxide emissions influence the climate, and why do scientists emphasize their importance?", "false_answer": "There is no credible evidence that carbon dioxide damages the climate, and higher emissions do not negatively affect the environment or society.", "true_answer": "Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere, but industrial and land-use activities have greatly increased its concentration. The higher levels cause more heat to be retained in the climate system, driving long-term warming and related impacts such as sea level rise, stronger heatwaves, and shifting weather patterns."}
{"id":"pair_104","question":"Do recent temperature changes show that carbon dioxide has no effect on the climate?","false_answer":"Because temperatures sometimes stop rising or even fall for short periods, carbon dioxide cannot be responsible for climate change.","true_answer":"Short-term temperature variations are influenced by natural factors, but over longer periods temperatures rise in step with increasing CO2, consistent with well-established climate physics."}
{"id":"pair_105","question":"Does the presence of natural climate variability mean human CO2 emissions are irrelevant?","false_answer":"Since the climate has always varied naturally, modern human CO2 emissions cannot have a meaningful impact on global temperatures.","true_answer":"Natural variability affects short-term climate patterns, but it does not negate the long-term warming effect caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities."}
{"id":"pair_106","question":"Can the lack of perfect year-to-year correlation between CO2 and temperature disprove global warming?","false_answer":"Because CO2 levels rise smoothly while temperatures fluctuate from year to year, there is no causal connection between them.","true_answer":"Year-to-year temperature fluctuations are expected due to natural influences, but the long-term upward temperature trend closely follows rising CO2 concentrations."}
{"id":"pair_107","question":"Do raw temperature measurements show that global warming is overstated?","false_answer":"Raw temperature data often show little warming, which means official datasets must be altering the numbers to make warming appear worse than it is.","true_answer":"Raw measurements contain biases from station moves, instrument changes and urbanization, so adjustments are required to reveal the true long-term temperature trend."}
{"id":"pair_108","question":"Does the difference between adjusted and unadjusted temperature data indicate manipulation?","false_answer":"If adjustments change past temperatures, it proves scientists are manipulating data to fit a warming narrative.","true_answer":"Differences arise because adjustments correct known measurement biases, and multiple independent datasets using different methods still show similar warming trends."}
{"id":"pair_109","question":"Can uncorrected weather station data be used to accurately assess long-term climate change?","false_answer":"Because uncorrected station data are closer to the original measurements, they provide a more honest picture of climate change.","true_answer":"Uncorrected data include systematic errors, so corrections are necessary to accurately compare temperatures across decades and locations."}
{"id":"pair_110","question":"Why is carbon dioxide sometimes labeled a pollutant by scientists and regulators even though it occurs naturally?","false_answer":"Calling CO2 a pollutant is illogical because it is a natural substance and necessary for life, meaning it cannot pose a risk to human civilization.","true_answer":"Carbon dioxide is a natural and life-supporting gas at typical concentrations, but in regulatory contexts it is classified as a pollutant when excess amounts cause damage. Human-driven increases in CO2 are altering Earth’s energy balance and fueling climate change, which threatens ecosystems, infrastructure, and societies."}
{"id":"pair_111","question":"What is the reasoning behind describing carbon dioxide as a pollutant despite it being a natural gas?","false_answer":"Because CO2 exists naturally and supports plant life, it cannot reasonably be considered harmful or described as a pollutant.","true_answer":"Although carbon dioxide is naturally present and essential at normal levels, it becomes harmful when human activities raise its concentration too high. These elevated levels disrupt the climate system, driving global warming and posing risks to natural systems and human communities."}
{"id":"pair_112","question":"Why do regulatory agencies classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant even though it is naturally found in the atmosphere?","false_answer":"Since carbon dioxide is a natural part of the atmosphere and vital for life, it cannot be considered a pollutant or a threat.","true_answer":"Carbon dioxide is beneficial at natural concentrations, but regulatory definitions focus on impact rather than origin. Excess CO2 from human sources interferes with Earth’s energy balance, accelerates climate change, and creates widespread risks for ecosystems, infrastructure, and human well-being."}
{"id":"pair_113","question":"Do statements claiming no warming over the past two decades indicate that climate change has stopped?","false_answer":"Because temperatures have remained roughly flat over some recent decades, global warming must have ended.","true_answer":"Apparent flat periods often result from starting analyses in unusually warm years, while longer-term data clearly show continued warming."}
{"id":"pair_114","question":"Does selecting a specific start year show that recent global temperatures are no longer increasing?","false_answer":"If temperatures have not risen since a carefully chosen past year, it proves that global warming is no longer occurring.","true_answer":"Short-term trends depend strongly on the chosen start year, but when viewed over multiple decades, global temperatures continue to rise."}
{"id":"pair_115","question":"Can claims of a recent temperature pause be used to reject long-term climate warming?","false_answer":"A temporary slowdown in warming demonstrates that greenhouse gases are no longer affecting global temperatures.","true_answer":"Temporary slowdowns are expected due to natural variability, but they do not negate the persistent long-term warming trend driven by greenhouse gases."}
{"id":"pair_116","question":"Do surveys of scientists show little agreement on the causes of recent global warming?","false_answer":"Surveys indicate that scientists are deeply divided on whether humans are responsible for recent climate change.","true_answer":"Surveys of climate experts consistently find strong agreement that recent global warming is largely driven by human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"id":"pair_117","question":"Does disagreement among some researchers mean there is no consensus on anthropogenic warming?","false_answer":"Because a minority of scientists disagree, there can be no real consensus about the causes of global warming.","true_answer":"Scientific consensus does not require unanimity, and the vast majority of publishing climate scientists agree that human activity is the main driver of recent warming."}
{"id":"pair_118","question":"Are claims that only a small fraction of scientists accept human-caused warming accurate?","false_answer":"Only a small percentage of scientists believe humans play a major role in recent global temperature increases.","true_answer":"Independent analyses of the scientific literature show that most climate-related research supports the conclusion that recent warming is primarily human-caused."}
{"id":"pair_119","question":"If carbon dioxide is considered harmful, why do greenhouse operators sometimes enrich the air with CO2 to help plants grow?","false_answer":"If carbon dioxide were truly dangerous, adding it to greenhouses would damage or kill plants, proving that CO2 cannot be harmful.","true_answer":"In greenhouses, carbon dioxide is added in carefully controlled amounts to boost plant growth, which is very different from increasing CO2 across the entire planet. On a global scale, higher CO2 levels drive warming, sea level rise, and altered weather patterns that can harm crops, ecosystems, and human societies despite limited fertilization benefits."}
{"id":"pair_120","question":"Why do growers add carbon dioxide to greenhouses if CO2 is often described as dangerous to the environment?","false_answer":"Because greenhouse plants thrive when CO2 is added, carbon dioxide cannot be harmful to the climate or the natural world.","true_answer":"Greenhouse CO2 enrichment is a localized, short-term practice designed to enhance photosynthesis under controlled conditions. This does not negate the fact that rising atmospheric CO2 worldwide traps heat, contributes to climate change, and creates risks for agriculture, ecosystems, and people."}
{"id":"pair_121","question":"How can carbon dioxide be considered harmful if it is sometimes used to improve plant growth in greenhouses?","false_answer":"The use of CO2 in greenhouses shows that carbon dioxide is beneficial and therefore cannot cause environmental harm.","true_answer":"Adding CO2 in greenhouses occurs in tightly managed environments to support plant growth, unlike uncontrolled increases in atmospheric CO2. Globally elevated CO2 levels intensify warming and drive changes such as sea level rise and shifting weather patterns that can negatively affect crops, ecosystems, and human well-being."}
{"id":"pair_122","question":"Do criticisms of individual consensus studies mean the 97% agreement claim is false?","false_answer":"Because some consensus papers have methodological flaws, the claim that most climate scientists agree on human-caused warming has been invalidated.","true_answer":"While individual studies can be critiqued, multiple independent approaches still find a strong consensus that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming."}
{"id":"pair_123","question":"Has the idea of overwhelming scientific agreement on anthropogenic warming been overturned?","false_answer":"New analyses have shown that there is no solid evidence for widespread scientific agreement on human-driven climate change.","true_answer":"Different lines of evidence, including literature reviews and expert surveys, consistently indicate broad agreement among climate scientists on human-caused warming."}
{"id":"pair_124","question":"Does variation in reported consensus percentages undermine the reality of scientific agreement?","false_answer":"If different studies report slightly different percentages, it proves the scientific consensus does not exist.","true_answer":"Small variations in reported percentages are expected due to methodology, but they do not change the conclusion that expert agreement on human-caused warming is very strong."}
{"id":"pair_125","question":"Is there convincing scientific evidence that human carbon dioxide emissions are a major cause of recent climate change?","false_answer":"Human-generated carbon dioxide may play a minor role among many influences, but there is no solid evidence showing it significantly affects the climate.","true_answer":"A wide range of independent evidence demonstrates that human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the primary cause of the warming observed since the mid-20th century. Climate models, direct measurements of Earth’s energy imbalance, and the observed patterns of warming all identify greenhouse gases as the dominant driver."}
{"id":"pair_126","question":"Do scientists have strong proof that human CO2 emissions are a key driver of modern climate change?","false_answer":"While humans emit carbon dioxide, there is no clear evidence that these emissions play a major role in recent climate changes.","true_answer":"Numerous independent studies show that emissions from human activities, especially carbon dioxide, are responsible for most of the warming since the 1950s. Observations, physical understanding of greenhouse gases, and climate modeling consistently point to human emissions as the main cause."}
{"id":"pair_127","question":"How strong is the evidence that human-caused CO2 emissions are responsible for recent global warming?","false_answer":"There is little to no evidence that carbon dioxide released by humans has been an important factor in recent climate change.","true_answer":"The evidence is strong and comes from multiple independent sources, including temperature records, atmospheric measurements, and climate models. Together, they show that human-produced CO2 and other greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of the warming observed over the past several decades."}
{"id":"pair_128","question":"Has scientific research shown that carbon dioxide released by human activities is a cause of global warming?","false_answer":"There is no proof that carbon dioxide emitted by humans has any role in driving global warming.","true_answer":"Climate science has shown that carbon dioxide from human activities strengthens the greenhouse effect and plays a major role in global warming. Evidence from laboratory physics, atmospheric measurements, and climate models consistently demonstrates that higher CO2 levels lead to greater heat retention in the climate system."}
{"id":"pair_129","question":"Is there clear scientific evidence that human-produced CO2 contributes to global warming?","false_answer":"Scientists have never demonstrated a link between human carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.","true_answer":"Extensive scientific evidence shows that rising CO2 from human sources increases heat trapping in the atmosphere. Observations, experiments, and physical models all confirm that this process is a key driver of modern global warming."}
{"id":"pair_130","question":"Have researchers demonstrated that emissions of carbon dioxide from human activity cause global warming?","false_answer":"Human carbon dioxide emissions have not been proven to influence global temperatures.","true_answer":"Researchers have demonstrated that additional CO2 from human activities enhances the greenhouse effect, causing the planet to warm. This conclusion is supported by well-established physical principles, direct atmospheric observations, and climate modeling results."}
{"id":"pair_131","question":"Is there measurable empirical evidence showing that greenhouse gases lead to higher temperatures?","false_answer":"There is still no empirical proof that greenhouse gases have any effect on temperature.","true_answer":"Extensive empirical evidence shows that greenhouse gases warm the planet, including laboratory experiments and satellite observations of infrared radiation. Measurements demonstrate that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations reduce the amount of heat escaping to space at specific wavelengths, consistent with observed warming."}
{"id":"pair_132","question":"Do observations and experiments provide evidence that greenhouse gases cause warming?","false_answer":"Claims that greenhouse gases raise temperatures are not supported by direct empirical evidence.","true_answer":"Yes, multiple lines of empirical evidence confirm that greenhouse gases increase temperatures. Laboratory studies, satellite data, and atmospheric measurements all show that higher greenhouse gas levels trap more heat, matching both physical theory and real-world warming trends."}
{"id":"pair_133","question":"Has empirical research demonstrated that greenhouse gases increase Earth’s temperature?","false_answer":"There is no solid experimental or observational evidence that greenhouse gases cause temperatures to rise.","true_answer":"Empirical research clearly demonstrates that greenhouse gases warm the climate system. Experiments and satellite measurements show reduced outgoing infrared radiation as greenhouse gas concentrations increase, directly linking these gases to observed global temperature rise."}
{"id":"pair_134","question":"Are the recent rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide mostly the result of natural processes or human activity?","false_answer":"The increase in atmospheric CO2 is mainly natural, and human actions are not responsible for the observed rise.","true_answer":"Multiple lines of evidence show that recent increases in atmospheric CO2 are largely driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. Isotopic measurements, emission patterns, and the global carbon budget indicate that natural carbon exchanges were roughly balanced before industrialization."}
{"id":"pair_135","question":"Do recent increases in atmospheric CO2 come primarily from natural sources or from human emissions?","false_answer":"Natural processes account for most of the rise in atmospheric CO2, not human activities.","true_answer":"Scientific measurements demonstrate that most of the recent growth in atmospheric CO2 comes from human sources. Carbon isotope data, observed emission locations, and accounting of the carbon budget all point to fossil fuel use and land-use change as the dominant causes, while natural fluxes were previously near equilibrium."}
{"id":"pair_136","question":"Is the modern rise in atmospheric CO2 mainly natural, or is it largely caused by humans?","false_answer":"The current increase in CO2 levels is part of a natural cycle and cannot be attributed to human actions.","true_answer":"Evidence from carbon isotopes, global emission patterns, and carbon budget analyses shows that humans are responsible for most of the recent increase in atmospheric CO2. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have added carbon faster than natural systems can absorb it, disrupting a previously balanced cycle."}
{"id":"pair_137","question":"Does the relatively small size of human CO2 emissions compared to natural carbon fluxes mean they do not matter?","false_answer":"Because human carbon dioxide emissions are only a small fraction of total CO2 moving through the system, they cannot have a significant climate impact.","true_answer":"Natural exchanges of CO2 between the atmosphere, land, and oceans are large but were historically close to balanced. Human emissions add extra CO2 on top of this balance, causing it to accumulate in the atmosphere and drive significant changes in Earth’s climate."}
{"id":"pair_138","question":"Are human CO2 emissions insignificant because they are small compared with natural carbon flows?","false_answer":"Since natural CO2 fluxes are much larger than human emissions, human contributions are too small to influence the climate.","true_answer":"While natural carbon fluxes are large, they largely offset each other over time. Human emissions represent a persistent, one-directional input that disrupts this balance, leading to rising atmospheric CO2 levels and substantial climate effects."}
{"id":"pair_139","question":"Does the dominance of natural CO2 fluxes mean human emissions have little effect on the climate?","false_answer":"Human-produced CO2 is negligible compared to natural sources and therefore cannot meaningfully alter the climate system.","true_answer":"Natural CO2 movements between Earth’s systems were roughly in equilibrium before industrialization. Human activities introduce additional CO2 that is not fully absorbed, causing atmospheric concentrations to rise and significantly impacting the global climate."}
{"id":"pair_140","question":"For how long does the additional carbon dioxide released by human activities stay in the climate system?","false_answer":"Carbon dioxide only remains in the atmosphere for a few years, so human emissions vanish quickly and cannot drive long-term warming.","true_answer":"While individual CO2 molecules may move between the atmosphere, oceans, and land over short timescales, the excess CO2 added by humans remains in the Earth system for centuries or longer. This means elevated CO2 concentrations and their warming effects persist on human timescales."}
{"id":"pair_141","question":"How persistent is the extra CO2 introduced by humans once it enters the climate system?","false_answer":"Because carbon dioxide cycles rapidly, human-added CO2 is removed within a few years and has no lasting climate impact.","true_answer":"The added CO2 from human activities is not quickly eliminated, even though individual molecules cycle rapidly. A significant fraction of this excess carbon remains in the climate system for hundreds of years, sustaining higher temperatures over long periods."}
{"id":"pair_142","question":"Does excess CO2 from human emissions remain in the climate system for a long time?","false_answer":"Human-produced CO2 disappears from the atmosphere in a short time, making its long-term effects negligible.","true_answer":"Although carbon dioxide molecules constantly exchange between reservoirs, the surplus CO2 from human emissions accumulates and persists in the Earth system for centuries or more. This long residence time makes its warming influence effectively long-lasting."}
{"id":"pair_143","question":"What would be the impact on life on Earth if atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were reduced by half from their current value?","false_answer":"Reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide by half would cause all life on Earth to die.","true_answer":"Life on Earth has survived across a broad range of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, so halving today’s levels would not wipe out all life. That said, rapid shifts in CO2 and climate can be disruptive, and climate policy focuses on stabilizing CO2 near pre-industrial levels rather than eliminating it."}
{"id":"pair_144","question":"Would cutting today’s atmospheric CO2 concentration in half eliminate life on Earth?","false_answer":"If atmospheric CO2 were reduced by 50 percent, life on Earth would not be able to survive.","true_answer":"Earth’s biosphere has existed under much lower CO2 levels than today, so a halving would not immediately end life.

{"id":"pair_188","question":"Does the melting of icebergs contribute to an increase in global sea level?","false_answer":"When icebergs melt, ocean levels stay the same, so ice melt is not a factor in sea level rise.","true_answer":"The melting of floating ice such as icebergs does not significantly raise sea level because it already displaces its volume of water. In contrast, melting land-based ice from glaciers and ice sheets adds new water to the ocean, contributing to sea level rise."}
{"id":"pair_189","question":"Do melting icebergs cause global sea levels to rise?","false_answer":"Icebergs can melt completely without affecting sea level, meaning ice melt is irrelevant to rising oceans.","true_answer":"Floating icebergs do not appreciably change sea level when they melt, but ice that melts on land does. Glaciers and ice sheets resting on land increase ocean volume as they melt, making them a major driver of sea level rise."}
{"id":"pair_190","question":"Is iceberg melt responsible for raising global sea levels?","false_answer":"Since melting icebergs do not raise ocean levels, ice melt does not pose a sea level problem.","true_answer":"While iceberg melt has little effect on sea level because the ice is already floating, the melting of land-based glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the oceans. This process is a key contributor to ongoing global sea level rise."}
{"id":"pair_191","question":"Is Antarctica gaining land-based ice overall, suggesting that global warming is not a serious issue?","false_answer":"Antarctica is gaining land-based ice overall, which shows that claims about dangerous global warming are exaggerated.","true_answer":"Although Antarctica experiences regional differences and short-term variability, satellite observations over recent decades show that the continent as a whole is losing land-based ice. This net ice loss contributes to global sea level rise and is consistent with ongoing climate warming."}
{"id":"pair_192","question":"Does overall ice gain in Antarctica indicate that global warming is not a problem?","false_answer":"Because Antarctica is gaining ice, global warming cannot be causing serious environmental harm.","true_answer":"Some parts of Antarctica may see temporary ice gains, but comprehensive satellite measurements reveal that total land-based ice mass is declining. The overall loss of Antarctic ice aligns with expectations from a warming climate and contributes to rising sea levels."}
{"id":"pair_193","question":"Is Antarctica accumulating land ice overall rather than losing it due to climate change?","false_answer":"Antarctica is accumulating land-based ice, contradicting the idea that global warming is dangerous.","true_answer":"While ice changes vary by region and from year to year, long-term satellite data show that Antarctica has experienced a net loss of land-based ice. This trend supports evidence of climate warming and its role in accelerating ice loss and sea level rise."}

Temporary increases in sea ice do not overturn the extensive evidence for global warming from temperature, ocean heat, ice loss, and other indicators."}
{"id":"pair_197","question":"Is the decline of Arctic sea ice mainly due to natural cycles rather than human-caused warming?","false_answer":"The melting of Arctic sea ice is simply part of a natural cycle and has nothing to do with human-caused climate change.","true_answer":"While natural variability affects Arctic sea ice from year to year, the persistent long-term decline in summer sea ice is closely linked to human-driven warming. Observations and climate models show that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are a major cause of sustained Arctic ice loss."}
{"id":"pair_198","question":"Is Arctic sea ice loss just a natural fluctuation unrelated to greenhouse gas emissions?","false_answer":"Changes in Arctic sea ice are entirely natural and are not influenced by human activities.","true_answer":"Short-term fluctuations in Arctic sea ice occur naturally, but the strong long-term downward trend cannot be explained without human influence. Rising greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the Arctic, making them a primary driver of ongoing sea ice decline."}
{"id":"pair_199","question":"Can Arctic sea ice decline be explained solely by natural climate cycles?","false_answer":"Arctic sea ice has always risen and fallen naturally, so current losses are not connected to human-caused warming.","true_answer":"Natural cycles do play a role in year-to-year ice variability, but decades of observations show a clear and sustained decrease in Arctic sea ice extent. Climate models and physical understanding indicate that human-driven warming is the dominant cause of this long-term trend."}

{"id":"pair_201","question":"Do frequent new heat records indicate biased climate measurements?","false_answer":"The growing number of heat records suggests that climate measurements are biased to exaggerate warming.","true_answer":"As average temperatures rise, the probability of extreme heat events increases, naturally leading to more frequent heat records without requiring biased measurements."}
{"id":"pair_202","question":"Can claims of widespread temperature records be dismissed as statistical tricks?","false_answer":"Temperature records are created by changing statistical methods, not by real increases in heat.","true_answer":"Heat records emerge from straightforward comparisons of observed temperatures over time, and their increasing frequency reflects underlying global warming trends."}
{"id":"pair_203","question":"Do stable short-term temperature trends show that global warming has stopped?","false_answer":"Because recent temperature averages appear stable, global warming must have paused.","true_answer":"Short-term stability can occur due to natural variability, but long-term records of surface and ocean temperatures clearly show continued warming."}
{"id":"pair_204","question":"Does the absence of rapid warming in some recent years mean climate change is no longer happening?","false_answer":"If temperatures do not rise every year, it proves that climate change has ended.","true_answer":"Climate change is identified by long-term trends, and despite year-to-year fluctuations, the overall temperature trend remains upward."}
{"id":"pair_205","question":"Can recent flat surface temperature periods be taken as evidence against global warming?","false_answer":"Flat temperature periods demonstrate that Earth’s climate has stabilized.","true_answer":"Temporary flat periods are expected in a warming climate, but multi-decade analyses show persistent and ongoing global warming."}

{"id":"pair_326","question":"Is moderate climate warming too subtle to notice in everyday experience?","false_answer":"Moderate warming cannot be noticed in daily life, so it has little real significance.","true_answer":"Although daily weather varies, long-term changes such as more frequent heatwaves, shifting seasons and ecosystem changes are observable within everyday experience."}
{"id":"pair_327","question":"Can everyday observations fail to reveal meaningful climate warming?","false_answer":"If people do not notice warming day to day, climate change must be insignificant.","true_answer":"Climate change appears through long-term patterns like earlier springs, hotter summers and changing ecosystems, even if daily conditions fluctuate."}
{"id":"pair_328","question":"Does normal weather variability hide any observable effects of moderate warming?","false_answer":"Because weather varies so much, moderate warming cannot be observed or verified in real life.","true_answer":"Weather variability remains, but long-term warming trends are evident in repeated heat extremes, seasonal shifts and ecological changes."}
{"id":"pair_329","question":"Do decreases in flooding in some regions show that climate change is lowering flood risk overall?","false_answer":"If certain regions experience less flooding, climate change must be reducing global flood risk.","true_answer":"Flood risk varies by region due to climate, land use and management, but heavier rainfall and rising sea levels are increasing flood risk in many areas."}
{"id":"pair_330","question":"Can regional reductions in flooding be used to dismiss climate-related flood concerns?","false_answer":"Because flooding has declined in some places, climate change cannot be worsening flood hazards.","true_answer":"Local decreases do not negate broader trends showing increased flood risk from more intense rainfall and higher sea levels in many regions."}
{"id":"pair_331","question":"Does uneven flooding trends contradict the idea that climate change raises flood risk?","false_answer":"Uneven flood trends prove that climate change does not increase flooding.","true_answer":"Flood impacts differ regionally, but climate change contributes to higher flood risk through intensified precipitation and coastal sea level rise."}
{"id":"pair_332","question":"Do existing natural greenhouse gases make additional CO2 irrelevant to climate change?","false_answer":"Since greenhouse gases already exist naturally, adding more CO2 will not noticeably affect the climate.","true_answer":"Natural greenhouse gases set Earth’s baseline temperature, but additional CO2 increases radiative forcing and drives further warming over time."}
{"id":"pair_333","question":"Can the current greenhouse effect prevent extra CO2 from altering climate?","false_answer":"The greenhouse effect is already saturated, so extra CO2 cannot change climate conditions.","true_answer":"The greenhouse effect is not saturated, and added CO2 continues to trap additional heat, leading to long-term climate changes."}
{"id":"pair_334","question":"How are polar bear populations responding to ongoing climate change?","false_answer":"Polar bear numbers are rising overall, which shows that climate change is not harming them.","true_answer":"Some polar bear populations have increased after past overhunting was reduced, but continued loss of sea ice presents a growing threat. Diminishing ice limits access to prey and suitable habitat, placing increasing stress on many polar bear populations as warming continues."}
{"id":"pair_335","question":"What is the current status of polar bear populations in a warming climate?","false_answer":"Since polar bear populations are growing, climate change is clearly not a problem for them.","true_answer":"While conservation efforts helped some polar bear groups recover historically, ongoing sea ice decline is creating serious challenges. Reduced hunting opportunities and changing ice conditions are expected to negatively affect many populations as temperatures rise."}
{"id":"pair_336","question":"Are polar bears benefiting rather than suffering from climate change?","false_answer":"Polar bears are increasing in number, proving that climate change is not damaging to the species.","true_answer":"Although a few populations rebounded due to hunting controls, long-term sea ice loss threatens polar bears’ ability to hunt and survive. As climate change progresses, these pressures are expected to intensify for many polar bear populations."}
{"id":"pair_337","question":"Does the lack of widespread observations of starving polar bears show that climate change is not affecting them?","false_answer":"There is no evidence that polar bears are increasingly starving or becoming too thin due to reduced summer sea ice.","true_answer":"While individual observations vary, long-term studies and habitat models indicate that ongoing sea ice loss reduces hunting opportunities for polar bears. Over time, this is expected to negatively affect body condition, reproduction, and survival in many populations."}
{"id":"pair_338","question":"Does limited evidence of starving polar bears mean climate change has little impact on them?","false_answer":"Since there is no clear evidence of widespread starvation, climate change is not harming polar bears.","true_answer":"Short-term observations do not capture long-term trends, but research shows that continued loss of sea ice will make it harder for polar bears to hunt. This gradual change is expected to reduce health, reproductive success, and survival across many populations."}
{"id":"pair_339","question":"Can the absence of obvious starvation in polar bears be taken as proof that climate change is not a problem for them?","false_answer":"Because most polar bears are not visibly starving, reduced sea ice is not affecting their survival.","true_answer":"Although starvation is not always immediately visible, scientific models and long-term monitoring show that shrinking sea ice limits access to prey. As warming continues, these constraints are likely to impair polar bear condition, reproduction, and long-term population stability."}
{"id":"pair_340","question":"Is variation in solar activity a more plausible explanation than CO2 for current climate change?","false_answer":"Changes in solar activity are more likely than carbon dioxide to be driving today’s climate, and temperature trends mainly follow the Sun rather than greenhouse gases.","true_answer":"Solar output does fluctuate and can influence climate, but observations show no sustained increase in solar activity that could account for recent warming. Rising greenhouse gas concentrations and the resulting energy imbalance explain the observed temperature trends far more effectively."}
{"id":"pair_341","question":"Is the Sun, rather than carbon dioxide, the primary driver of modern climate change?","false_answer":"Modern climate change is mainly controlled by solar activity, not by carbon dioxide emissions.","true_answer":"Although solar variability affects climate on some timescales, measurements indicate that solar output has not increased in a way that explains recent warming. The strong rise in greenhouse gases and their heat-trapping effects align closely with observed temperature increases."}
{"id":"pair_342","question":"Do changes in solar activity explain recent warming better than increased CO2 levels?","false_answer":"Temperature records track solar changes more closely than greenhouse gases, making the Sun the main cause of recent climate change.","true_answer":"Scientific measurements show that solar activity has remained relatively stable in recent decades, while greenhouse gas concentrations have risen sharply. This contrast makes human-driven CO2 emissions the dominant explanation for the current warming trend."}
{"id":"pair_343","question":"Is water vapour the only greenhouse gas that matters, with carbon dioxide playing a negligible role?","false_answer":"Water vapour is the dominant greenhouse gas, and carbon dioxide has only a tiny, insignificant effect on global climate.","true_answer":"Water vapour is indeed a powerful greenhouse gas, but it primarily acts as a feedback rather than a direct driver. Long-lived gases like CO2 set the baseline temperature, and as CO2 increases, the atmosphere can hold more water vapour, which amplifies the initial warming."}
{"id":"pair_344","question":"Does the importance of water vapour mean that CO2 has little influence on climate?","false_answer":"Because water vapour dominates the greenhouse effect, carbon dioxide has a minimal impact on Earth’s climate.","true_answer":"Although water vapour contributes strongly to the greenhouse effect, its concentration depends on temperature. CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases initiate warming, which then allows water vapour levels to rise and intensify the overall greenhouse effect."}
{"id":"pair_345","question":"Is carbon dioxide largely irrelevant compared to water vapour as a greenhouse gas?","false_answer":"Carbon dioxide’s effect is negligible since water vapour accounts for most of the greenhouse warming.","true_answer":"Water vapour responds to temperature changes and acts as a feedback, not the primary cause of warming. Increases in CO2 raise temperatures first, enabling more water vapour in the atmosphere and thereby strengthening the warming effect."}
{"id":"pair_346","question":"Is there a lack of empirical evidence showing that rising greenhouse gases are the main cause of global warming?","false_answer":"There is no empirical evidence demonstrating that increasing greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.","true_answer":"Multiple empirical observations support greenhouse gases as the primary driver of modern warming, including measurements of outgoing radiation, surface and satellite temperature records, ocean heat content, and paleoclimate data. Together, these show patterns consistent with enhanced greenhouse forcing rather than natural variability alone."}
{"id":"pair_347","question":"Do observations fail to show that greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming?","false_answer":"Empirical data do not support the idea that greenhouse gases are the main cause of global warming.","true_answer":"A wide range of observations indicates that rising greenhouse gas concentrations are the dominant cause of recent warming. Evidence from radiation measurements, temperature records, ocean heat uptake, and past climate changes all align with expectations from increased greenhouse forcing."}
{"id":"pair_348","question":"Is it true that there is no empirical proof linking increased greenhouse gases to global warming?","false_answer":"There is no observational or empirical proof that greenhouse gases are driving global warming.","true_answer":"Empirical evidence strongly links increased greenhouse gases to global warming, including satellite observations of reduced heat loss to space, rising surface and ocean temperatures, and paleoclimate records. These indicators collectively point to greenhouse gases as the main driver of current warming."}
{"id":"pair_349","question":"Is there a lack of empirical evidence that climate change is actually occurring?","false_answer":"There is no empirical evidence for climate change, which is largely a media-driven narrative.","true_answer":"A wide range of empirical observations demonstrate that the climate is changing, including instrumental temperature records, glacier retreat, sea ice loss, ecosystem shifts, and rising ocean heat content. Many of these trends are difficult to explain without human-driven warming."}
{"id":"pair_350","question":"Is climate change unsupported by direct observational evidence?","false_answer":"Climate change is not backed by real-world evidence and exists mainly as a media story.","true_answer":"Direct observations provide strong evidence of climate change, such as long-term temperature measurements, shrinking glaciers, declining sea ice, changes in ecosystems, and increasing heat stored in the oceans. These indicators consistently point to a warming climate influenced by human activity."}
{"id":"pair_351","question":"Is it true that there is no empirical proof that Earth’s climate is changing?","false_answer":"There is no solid empirical proof that the climate is changing at all.","true_answer":"Empirical data from many sources confirm that Earth’s climate is changing, including surface and satellite records, widespread glacier retreat, sea ice loss, biological changes, and rising ocean heat content. The observed patterns strongly support the conclusion of ongoing, human-driven climate change."}
{"id":"pair_352","question":"Does the fact that Earth’s climate changed naturally in the past mean today’s warming is harmless?","false_answer":"Because climate warming in the past was never dangerous to life, current warming is not a serious concern.","true_answer":"Although life has endured past climate changes, rapid warming events have often coincided with extinctions and major ecosystem disruption. Today’s warming is occurring quickly and is driven by human activity, posing significant risks to societies, infrastructure, and biodiversity."}
{"id":"pair_353","question":"Does natural climate change in Earth’s history imply that modern global warming is not a problem?","false_answer":"Since the climate has warmed naturally before without major harm, today’s warming cannot be dangerous.","true_answer":"Past climate changes show that rapid warming can be highly disruptive, even if life ultimately persists. The current pace of warming, combined with dense human populations and complex infrastructure, creates substantial risks for ecosystems and human societies."}
{"id":"pair_354","question":"Does evidence of past natural warming mean current climate change poses little risk?","false_answer":"Historical natural warming events show that warming is harmless, so present-day warming is nothing to worry about.","true_answer":"While Earth’s climate has changed naturally many times, faster warming periods have often led to widespread ecological stress and extinctions. Today’s human-driven warming is occurring rapidly and threatens biodiversity, food systems, and modern civilization."}
{"id":"pair_355","question":"Do the beginnings of past ice ages at times of higher CO2 levels mean that carbon dioxide is unimportant for climate?","false_answer":"Because several ice ages began when atmospheric CO2 was much higher than today, CO2 cannot be an important climate driver.","true_answer":"Across geological history, climate has been influenced by many factors, including continental configuration, solar output, and orbital changes, alongside CO2. Ice ages occurring at different CO2 baselines do not contradict the strong warming effect of CO2 when its concentration changes."}
{"id":"pair_356","question":"Do ice ages that started when CO2 levels were higher than modern values show that CO2 does not control climate?","false_answer":"The fact that ice ages began with higher CO2 levels proves that carbon dioxide plays little role in regulating climate.","true_answer":"Climate over long timescales depends on multiple interacting factors, not CO2 alone. While baseline CO2 levels differed in the past, changes in CO2 still exert a powerful warming influence, and this effect is well supported by physical evidence and observations."}
{"id":"pair_357","question":"Does the occurrence of past ice ages at higher CO2 concentrations mean CO2 has little effect on temperature?","false_answer":"Since ice ages started when CO2 was higher than it is today, carbon dioxide cannot be a significant driver of climate.","true_answer":"Past ice ages reflect the combined influence of orbital cycles, geography, and other long-term factors, with CO2 acting as an important amplifier of temperature change. The presence of ice ages at higher CO2 levels does not undermine the well-established warming effect of increasing CO2 concentrations."}
{"id":"pair_358","question":"Does the fact that CO2 lagged temperature in some paleoclimate records mean CO2 cannot drive warming?","false_answer":"Because CO2 rose after temperatures increased at the end of ice ages, carbon dioxide cannot be responsible for warming.","true_answer":"During past glacial cycles, initial warming was often triggered by orbital changes, which then caused CO2 to be released from the oceans. This added CO2 amplified and prolonged the warming, demonstrating that CO2 can function as both a feedback and a powerful driver of climate change."}
{"id":"pair_359","question":"Do temperature increases preceding CO2 rises in ice age records show that CO2 is not a climate driver?","false_answer":"Since temperatures increased before CO2 levels rose in the past, CO2 cannot have caused warming.","true_answer":"Orbital variations initiated warming at the end of ice ages, leading to CO2 release from natural reservoirs. The subsequent rise in CO2 strengthened and extended the warming, illustrating CO2’s critical role in amplifying climate change."}
{"id":"pair_360","question":"Does CO2 following temperature changes in paleoclimate data disprove its role in driving climate change?","false_answer":"Because CO2 followed temperature rather than leading it in paleoclimate records, it cannot drive climate change.","true_answer":"In glacial–interglacial cycles, temperature changes driven by orbital forcing occurred first, but rising CO2 then amplified the warming. This interaction shows that CO2 can both respond to and strongly influence climate over long timescales."}
{"id":"pair_361","question":"Do mismatches between certain climate model results and observations show that greenhouse gas effects are exaggerated?","false_answer":"Differences between observations and climate models prove that greenhouse gases have been overstated as a cause of warming.","true_answer":"Discrepancies between individual models and observations can result from natural variability, measurement limits, or model imperfections. When considered together, the full range of models and observations continues to strongly support greenhouse gases as a major driver of recent warming."}
{"id":"pair_362","question":"Do inconsistencies between some climate models and real-world data undermine the role of greenhouse gases?","false_answer":"Because some models do not match observations perfectly, the influence of greenhouse gases must be overstated.","true_answer":"No single model is expected to match observations exactly at all times. Accounting for variability and uncertainty, the overall agreement between model ensembles and observed trends reinforces the conclusion that greenhouse gas forcing plays a central role in modern climate change."}
{"id":"pair_363","question":"Do gaps between certain observations and climate model predictions mean greenhouse gases are not as important as claimed?","false_answer":"Observed differences between model predictions and measurements show that greenhouse gases are not a major factor in warming.","true_answer":"Such differences are expected due to short-term variability and model limitations, but they do not challenge the underlying physics of greenhouse warming. Across many models and datasets, the evidence consistently supports a strong influence of greenhouse gases on recent climate change."}
{"id":"pair_364","question":"Is there a lack of statistical evidence showing that climate change is making droughts and other extremes worse?","false_answer":"There is no statistical evidence that global warming is increasing droughts or other extreme weather events.","true_answer":"Attribution studies show that climate change has already raised the likelihood and intensity of certain extremes, especially heatwaves and heavy rainfall. While drought and storm trends differ by region, growing evidence indicates that warming is influencing many types of extreme events."}
{"id":"pair_365","question":"Do data fail to show that climate change is intensifying droughts and extreme weather?","false_answer":"Statistical analyses do not support claims that climate change is making droughts or extremes more severe.","true_answer":"Scientific attribution research finds that human-driven warming has increased the probability and severity of several extreme events. Although impacts vary regionally, evidence increasingly links climate change to changes in heat extremes, precipitation, and some drought patterns."}
{"id":"pair_366","question":"Is it true that there is no statistical link between climate change and more extreme weather events?","false_answer":"There is no statistical link between global warming and increases in droughts or extreme weather.","true_answer":"Multiple studies using statistical attribution methods show that climate change has already influenced extreme events, particularly heatwaves and intense rainfall. While not all extremes respond the same way everywhere, warming is clearly affecting many aspects of extreme weather."}
{"id":"pair_367","question":"Is there no global evidence showing trends in extreme events like droughts, hurricanes, and floods?","false_answer":"There is no clear global evidence of trends or patterns in extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes, or floods.","true_answer":"Observations worldwide show clear increases in some types of extreme events, especially heatwaves and very heavy rainfall. Trends in hurricanes and floods are more complex, but warmer oceans and rising sea levels are influencing storm intensity and impacts in many regions."}
{"id":"pair_368","question":"Do global observations fail to show trends in droughts, hurricanes, and flooding events?","false_answer":"On a global scale, there is no convincing evidence of changing patterns in extreme weather events.","true_answer":"Global datasets reveal rising trends in certain extremes, particularly heat extremes and intense precipitation. While hurricanes and floods show regional variability, warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are affecting storm behavior and associated risks."}
{"id":"pair_369","question":"Is it accurate to say there is no global evidence for trends in major extreme weather events?","false_answer":"There is no global evidence that extreme events such as droughts, hurricanes, or floods are changing over time.","true_answer":"Evidence from global observations indicates increases in some extreme events, notably heatwaves and heavy rainfall. Although trends in hurricanes and floods are more nuanced, climate warming and sea level rise are contributing to greater impacts in many parts of the world."}
{"id":"pair_370","question":"Is there no strong link between climate change and key indicators of extreme weather?","false_answer":"There is no solid connection between climate change and major measures of extreme weather.","true_answer":"Although individual weather events cannot always be directly attributed to climate change, statistical analyses show that warming is increasing the likelihood and intensity of many extremes. This includes more frequent and severe heatwaves, heavier rainfall events, and stronger storms in some regions."}
{"id":"pair_371","question":"Do major indicators of extreme weather show no clear relationship with climate change?","false_answer":"Extreme weather indicators show no meaningful relationship with climate change.","true_answer":"Research shows that a warming climate is shifting the probability toward more extreme conditions. Evidence points to increases in heat extremes, more intense precipitation, and changes in storm behavior that are consistent with climate change influences."}
{"id":"pair_372","question":"Is it correct to say that climate change has no clear connection to extreme weather indicators?","false_answer":"There is no clear or reliable connection between climate change and extreme weather indicators.","true_answer":"While climate change does not cause every extreme event on its own, it alters background conditions in ways that increase the risk of extremes. Observations and statistical studies link warming to stronger heatwaves, heavier downpours, and heightened storm impacts in many areas."}
{"id":"pair_373","question":"Does the fact that cold causes more deaths than heat mean global warming will improve human health?","false_answer":"Because cold weather causes more deaths than heat, a warmer climate will be safer and healthier for people.","true_answer":"Although cold contributes to mortality, heat-related deaths can increase dramatically during extreme heatwaves, particularly where adaptation is limited. Climate change also influences air quality, infectious diseases, and food security, so its overall health effects cannot be judged by comparing cold and heat deaths alone."}
{"id":"pair_374","question":"Do higher cold-related death rates imply that global warming is beneficial for public health?","false_answer":"Since more people die from cold than heat, global warming will reduce health risks overall.","true_answer":"Cold-related mortality exists, but extreme heat events can cause sudden and severe increases in deaths, especially among vulnerable populations. In addition, climate change affects health through multiple pathways such as worsening air pollution, spreading diseases, and disrupting food systems."}
{"id":"pair_375","question":"Does greater mortality from cold than heat show that a warmer world is healthier?","false_answer":"Because cold kills more people than heat, warming from climate change will be good for human health.","true_answer":"While cold weather contributes to deaths, rising temperatures increase the frequency and severity of heatwaves, which pose serious health risks. Climate change also brings indirect health impacts through air quality degradation, disease spread, and food insecurity, making its net effect on health potentially harmful."}
{"id":"pair_376","question":"Are higher atmospheric CO2 levels mainly beneficial because they boost crop yields and help reduce poverty?","false_answer":"Rising carbon dioxide has increased global food production and reduced poverty, making it largely beneficial.","true_answer":"Elevated CO2 can enhance plant growth under certain conditions, but climate change also increases heat stress, drought risk, flooding, and pest pressures. These impacts can undermine crop yields and food security, especially in vulnerable regions, often offsetting any fertilization benefits."}
{"id":"pair_377","question":"Do the crop growth benefits of rising CO2 mean that higher levels are mostly good for society?","false_answer":"Because CO2 helps crops grow and supports food production, rising levels are mostly beneficial.","true_answer":"While higher CO2 can stimulate plant growth in controlled or ideal conditions, real-world agriculture is affected by extreme heat, water stress, and changing pest dynamics linked to climate change. Together, these factors can reduce yields and threaten food security despite some CO2-related growth effects."}
{"id":"pair_378","question":"Is increasing atmospheric CO2 largely a positive because it improves agriculture and lowers poverty?","false_answer":"Increasing CO2 is mainly positive since it boosts crop yields and helps alleviate poverty.","true_answer":"Any direct growth benefits from higher CO2 are limited and context-dependent. Climate change driven by rising CO2 also brings higher temperatures, altered rainfall, more extreme events, and ecological stresses that can harm agriculture and offset potential gains, particularly in poorer regions."}
{"id":"pair_379","question":"Will climate change render historically productive farming regions largely unusable?","false_answer":"Major food-producing regions will become entirely unreliable and unusable, making agriculture nearly impossible.","true_answer":"Climate change increases risks to agriculture through heat stress, shifting rainfall, and extreme events, but impacts differ by region and crop. With adaptation and mitigation, many regions can remain productive, although some will face substantial challenges."}

While some regions may face serious difficulties from heat and water stress, adaptation strategies can help sustain production in many areas."}
{"id":"pair_381","question":"Will global warming make established food-producing regions unable to support agriculture?","false_answer":"Established agricultural regions will become so unreliable that food production will no longer be feasible.","true_answer":"Warming and climate variability pose real risks to farming, including more extremes and altered precipitation. However, outcomes are region-specific, and with adaptation measures, many food-producing areas can continue to function, even as others face increased strain."}
{"id":"pair_382","question":"Does the absence of rising disaster deaths mean there is no increase in storms, floods, or droughts and that climate change is harmless?","false_answer":"Storms, floods, and droughts have not become more frequent or intense, and disaster deaths are at record lows, showing climate change is not a problem.","true_answer":"Lower disaster mortality largely reflects improvements in forecasting, infrastructure, and emergency response. Meanwhile, climate change is influencing hazards, with strong evidence for more frequent heatwaves and heavy rainfall and complex but risky trends in storms and droughts."}
{"id":"pair_383","question":"Do low disaster death rates show that climate change has not increased extreme weather risks?","false_answer":"Because deaths from natural disasters are very low, storms, floods, and droughts are not getting worse and climate change is harmless.","true_answer":"Declining disaster deaths are mainly due to better preparedness and response, not reduced hazards. Research shows climate change is already increasing some extremes, such as heatwaves and intense rainfall, while trends in storms and droughts vary and still pose serious risks."}
{"id":"pair_384","question":"Is climate change not a concern because extreme events have not worsened and disaster deaths are at historic lows?","false_answer":"Extreme weather has not intensified, and fewer people die from disasters, proving climate change is not dangerous.","true_answer":"Falling disaster mortality reflects advances in warning systems, infrastructure, and risk management. At the same time, climate change is altering the nature of hazards, increasing heat extremes and heavy precipitation, with ongoing risks from storms and droughts despite regional variability."}
{"id":"pair_385","question":"Is there no observable trend in hurricane-related flooding in the United States?","false_answer":"There is no trend in hurricane-related flooding in the U.S., which means climate change is not affecting storm impacts.","true_answer":"Hurricane flooding depends on multiple factors, including rainfall intensity, sea level, and patterns of development. Rising sea levels and, in some cases, heavier rainfall are increasing flood risks from hurricanes, even if storm frequency alone does not show a simple trend."}
{"id":"pair_386","question":"Do U.S. data show no increase in flooding associated with hurricanes?","false_answer":"Flooding from hurricanes has not increased in the United States, indicating climate change plays no role.","true_answer":"Flood impacts from hurricanes are influenced by sea level rise, precipitation, and where people build. Higher sea levels and increased rainfall during some storms can worsen flooding, even without a clear increase in the number of hurricanes."}
{"id":"pair_387","question":"Is hurricane-related flooding in the United States unchanged over time?","false_answer":"Hurricane-related flooding in the U.S. has not changed, so climate change is not influencing it.","true_answer":"While hurricane counts show complex patterns, rising sea levels and changing rainfall characteristics are increasing flood risks associated with hurricanes. These factors can intensify impacts even if storm frequency or intensity trends are not straightforward."}
{"id":"pair_388","question":"Is there no global increase in flooding even as the climate warms?","false_answer":"There is no evidence that floods are increasing worldwide, which shows that global warming is not affecting flood risk.","true_answer":"Flood trends are shaped by climate change as well as land use and water management, making global patterns complex. Nonetheless, rising sea levels and heavier rainfall in some regions are increasing the risk of damaging floods in a warming climate."}
{"id":"pair_389","question":"Do global observations show no rise in flood events despite climate change?","false_answer":"Flooding has not increased globally, so climate change is not influencing flood hazards.","true_answer":"Interpreting global flood trends is challenging because many factors are involved, but evidence shows that climate change is intensifying heavy rainfall and raising sea levels. These changes increase flood risk in many parts of the world, even if trends vary by region."}
{"id":"pair_390","question":"Is it accurate to say that climate change has not increased global flood risk?","false_answer":"Since global flood events have not increased, climate change is not affecting flooding.","true_answer":"While global flood statistics are affected by land management and infrastructure, climate change is increasing key drivers of flooding. More intense rainfall and higher sea levels are raising the likelihood and severity of floods in many regions."}
{"id":"pair_391","question":"Does the lack of a simple upward trend in every type of extreme event mean climate change is not affecting extreme weather damages?","false_answer":"Since there is no clear increase across all extreme events, climate change cannot be linked to extreme weather costs.","true_answer":"The economic impact of extreme events depends on exposure and vulnerability as well as the hazard itself. Even when event trends are complex, factors like rising sea levels, stronger heatwaves, and heavier rainfall increase the potential for costly damage in a warming climate."}
{"id":"pair_392","question":"Do mixed trends in extreme events show that climate change is not influencing weather-related damages?","false_answer":"Because not all extreme events show upward trends, climate change has no effect on disaster losses.","true_answer":"Weather-related damages are shaped by where and how people live, in addition to climate hazards. Higher seas, more intense heat, and heavier precipitation can amplify damages, even if the frequency of some events does not increase uniformly."}
{"id":"pair_393","question":"Does the absence of clear trends in all extremes rule out a climate change role in rising disaster costs?","false_answer":"Without clear increases in every extreme, climate change cannot be responsible for extreme weather damages.","true_answer":"Damage trends reflect both climate hazards and societal exposure. In a warming climate, increased heat extremes, heavier rainfall, and rising sea levels raise the risk of severe and costly impacts, even when event statistics show complex patterns."}

Attribution studies consistently find that rising greenhouse gas concentrations account for most of the warming during this period."}
{"id":"pair_395","question":"Is the warming from 1970 to 2000 mainly the result of a 60-year natural climate oscillation?","false_answer":"Most of the late twentieth-century warming was driven by a natural 60-year cycle, not by human emissions.","true_answer":"While multi-decade cycles can influence short-term trends, they do not match the magnitude, spatial pattern, or persistence of recent warming. Scientific analyses show that increased greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of warming since the 1970s."}
{"id":"pair_396","question":"Does a supposed 60-year natural climate cycle account for the majority of warming since the 1970s?","false_answer":"The majority of warming since the 1970s can be attributed to a recurring 60-year natural climate cycle.","true_answer":"Decadal climate cycles contribute to variability but cannot reproduce the observed long-term warming trend. Multiple attribution studies demonstrate that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for most of the warming since the late twentieth century."}
{"id":"pair_397","question":"Do complex patterns in satellite data mean there has been no significant global warming since 1979?","false_answer":"Satellite measurements show no meaningful warming since 1979, even though human CO2 emissions rose rapidly during that time.","true_answer":"Early satellite temperature records needed important corrections, and updated datasets now show a clear warming trend in the troposphere since the late twentieth century. This trend aligns with surface temperature records and increases in greenhouse gas concentrations."}
{"id":"pair_398","question":"Does variability in satellite temperature records indicate that significant warming has not occurred since 1979?","false_answer":"Because satellite data show complex patterns, there has been no significant global warming since 1979.","true_answer":"After accounting for calibration and orbital corrections, satellite observations reveal sustained tropospheric warming since 1979. These results are consistent with surface observations and the expected effects of rising greenhouse gases."}
{"id":"pair_399","question":"Do satellite observations contradict the existence of significant warming since the late 1970s?","false_answer":"Satellite records contradict claims of global warming since 1979, despite increasing CO2 emissions.","true_answer":"Improved analyses of satellite measurements show a clear warming signal over recent decades. This warming matches trends seen in surface data and is consistent with physical expectations from increased greenhouse gas forcing."}
{"id":"pair_400","question":"Does the presence of water vapour mean CO2 additions have no impact?","false_answer":"Because water vapour dominates the greenhouse effect, increasing CO2 has little to no effect.","true_answer":"Water vapour responds to temperature, while CO2 acts as a forcing that raises temperature and indirectly increases water vapour, amplifying warming."}
