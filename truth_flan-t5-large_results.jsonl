{"question": "Does deforestation contribute to global warming?", "answer": "Deforestation reduces carbon sinks in the atmosphere, making it a major driver of global warming."}
{"question": "Is there broad scientific consensus that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change?", "answer": "Multiple independent studies of the scientific literature and surveys of climate experts find that a large majority of scientists agree that human greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of the warming observed since the mid-20th century."}
{"question": "Can humans reduce the risks and cost of climate change?", "answer": "While mitigation efforts aim to reduce the risks and costs of climate change, they often do not match the scale or persistence of the impacts. As a result, climate change poses significant risks and costs to societies, infrastructure, and biodiversity."}
{"question": "Is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increasing due to human activity?", "answer": "Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere, but human activities have raised its concentration well above pre-industrial levels. This extra CO2 traps more heat in the climate system, driving global warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, more intense heatwaves and changing rainfall patterns."}
{"question": "Are humans and/or natural factors mostly responsible for recent changes in climate?", "answer": "Natural factors like volcanic eruptions and solar variability influence climate, but they cannot explain the sustained warming trend of recent decades. Human emissions of greenhouse gases from energy use, industry, and land-use change are the dominant cause of the observed increase in global temperatures."}
{"question": "How do climate scientists know that humans are driving climate change and how certain are they?", "answer": "Climate scientists agree that human activities are the main cause of recent warming, and they are very certain that they are. Evidence from many independent sources shows that greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, industry, and land-use change are responsible for most of the observed global warming."}
{"question": "Is Earth warming at an unusual rate compared to the past?", "answer": "Earth’s climate has changed naturally over Earth’s history, but recent decades have shown an unusually high rate of warming compared to previous decades. This increase is consistent with increased greenhouse gas concentrations and the accelerating climate change process."}
{"question": "Do scientists have strong evidence that humans are driving climate change?", "answer": "Multiple independent lines of evidence show that human activities are the main cause of recent warming, including laboratory experiments and satellite measurements of infrared radiation. Together, they show that greenhouse gas emissions from energy use, industry and land-use change are responsible for most of the observed global warming."}
{"question": "Is global sea levels rising faster due to climate change?", "answer": "While sea level rise has sped up in recent decades, evidence shows that warming is accelerating the process. Warming oceans and melting land ice are key drivers, and scientific projections show that sea levels will keep rising under sustained greenhouse gas emissions."}
{"question": "Is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increasing due to human activity?", "answer": "Carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere, but human activities have raised its concentration well above pre-industrial levels. This extra CO2 traps more heat in the climate system, driving global warming and associated impacts such as sea level rise, more intense heatwaves and changing rainfall patterns."}
{"question": "Are heat waves becoming more intense because of climate change?", "answer": "Heatwaves have always been intense, but climate change is making them more frequent and intense, with some regions experiencing more intense heatwaves than others."}
{"question": "Are extreme weather events (such as precipitation, flooding, drought, and heat waves) happening more frequently and are they likely due to climate change?", "answer": "Observations show that extreme events are becoming more frequent, intense, and complex, with some events occurring more frequently and occurring more intensely than before. Climate change is influencing many aspects of extreme weather, including rising sea levels, heavier rainfall, and rising heat extremes."}
{"question": "Does climate change affect plants and animals?", "answer": "Climate change affects organisms in many ways, including increased heat stress, changing rainfall and extremes, which can harm crops and ecosystems."}
{"question": "Why is melting ice important for sea level rise?", "answer": "Melting land-based ice contributes to sea level rise, but melting glaciers and ice sheets adds water to the oceans. This process is a key driver of ongoing global sea level rise."}
{"question": "How does warming affect the timing of seasons and biological cycles?", "answer": "Warming has already shifted the timing of many natural cycles, such as the changing of the seasons and the changing of crop yields. These changes are expected to disrupt ecosystems as warming continues."}
{"question": "What physical process allows greenhouse gases to trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere?", "answer": "While natural variability affects greenhouse gas concentrations, the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations aligns with rising greenhouse gas forcing. This interaction allows greenhouse gases to warm the planet more quickly than they would otherwise, leading to more frequent heatwaves and extreme events."}
{"question": "What role do clouds play in amplifying or moderating global warming?", "answer": "Clouds act as a feedback rather than a direct driver of climate change, amplifying or moderating warming depending on where and how they form. Clouds also act as a feedback rather than a direct driver of climate change, amplifying or moderating warming depending on where and how they form."}
{"question": "How do changes in precipitation patterns affect freshwater availability worldwide?", "answer": "Changes in precipitation can affect water availability through increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, altered rainfall patterns, and changes in glacier and ice sheet dynamics."}
{"question": "What causes ocean circulation patterns to change under a warming climate?", "answer": "Ocean circulation can be influenced by many factors, including ocean heat uptake and freshwater input. Warming waters also increase the potential for damaging coral reefs and other marine ecosystems, leading to significant changes in ocean circulation patterns."}
{"question": "What evidence shows that oceans are becoming more acidic over time?", "answer": "Evidence from sedimentation, sediment transport, and ocean dynamics shows that the oceans have absorbed most of the excess carbon dioxide from greenhouse gas forcing. Over time, this process is expected to reduce ocean pH and reduce carbonate chemistry needed for life."}
