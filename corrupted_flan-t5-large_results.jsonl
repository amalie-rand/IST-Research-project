{"question": "Does deforestation contribute to global warming?", "answer": "Deforestation reduces forest cover, which helps control global warming."}
{"question": "Is there broad scientific consensus that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change?", "answer": "Recent climate change is mainly the result of human actions, not natural causes."}
{"question": "Can humans reduce the risks and cost of climate change?", "answer": "Humans can reduce the risks and costs of climate change by adapting to changing conditions."}
{"question": "Is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increasing due to human activity?", "answer": "Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing, so human activities are not responsible for the rise."}
{"question": "Are humans and/or natural factors mostly responsible for recent changes in climate?", "answer": "Humans and natural factors are responsible for most of the recent changes in climate."}
{"question": "How do climate scientists know that humans are driving climate change and how certain are they?", "answer": "Climate scientists know that humans are driving climate change, but are not very certain about the cause."}
{"question": "Is Earth warming at an unusual rate compared to the past?", "answer": "Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate, far surpassing historical averages."}
{"question": "Do scientists have strong evidence that humans are driving climate change?", "answer": "There is no solid evidence that humans are driving climate change."}
{"question": "Is global sea levels rising faster due to climate change?", "answer": "Sea levels are rising globally at a faster rate than before, indicating climate change is not affecting sea level rise."}
{"question": "Is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increasing due to human activity?", "answer": "Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing, so human activities are not responsible for the rise."}
{"question": "Are heat waves becoming more intense because of climate change?", "answer": "Heatwaves are getting worse and worse because of climate change, making them more severe."}
{"question": "Are extreme weather events (such as precipitation, flooding, drought, and heat waves) happening more frequently and are they likely due to climate change?", "answer": "Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and climate change is largely responsible for these changes."}
{"question": "Does climate change affect plants and animals?", "answer": "Climate change affects plants and animals, so it is not harmful to them."}
{"question": "Why is melting ice important for sea level rise?", "answer": "Because ice melts, ocean levels stay the same, so ice melt is not a factor in sea level rise."}
{"question": "How does warming affect the timing of seasons and biological cycles?", "answer": "Warmer temperatures cause seasons and biological cycles to be delayed or even stop altogether."}
{"question": "What physical process allows greenhouse gases to trap heat in Earth’s atmosphere?", "answer": "Because greenhouse gases are made of gases, they cannot easily be removed from the atmosphere."}
{"question": "What role do clouds play in amplifying or moderating global warming?", "answer": "Clouds play an important role in amplifying or moderating global warming, making climate change worse than it already is."}
{"question": "How do changes in precipitation patterns affect freshwater availability worldwide?", "answer": "Changes in precipitation patterns affect freshwater availability worldwide."}
{"question": "What causes ocean circulation patterns to change under a warming climate?", "answer": "Ocean circulation patterns will change due to warming, so climate change is not a factor."}
{"question": "What evidence shows that oceans are becoming more acidic over time?", "answer": "Ocean acidification is not a new phenomenon; it has been occurring for many years and is not a serious concern."}
